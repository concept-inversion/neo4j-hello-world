To someone who thinks that AI is worth using, they've already decided it's worth letting out of the box.

But I disagree about considering all implementation related questions off-topic.  I added additional commentary to the linked Area 51 post.

27,91,"1",The question presumes that the reason for a search engine being considered AI would be because it analyzes and remembers searches.

1174,1293,"0",pzombies are kind of a debated thing though; it's rather weird to say that you can know that an AGI has no consciousness if, following Chalmers words, there is no difference in the actions taken by zombies and people; if it is unethical to kill other people, but you cannot verify if they are pzombie or person, how is it ethical to kill an AGI?

1179,1298,"1",@Pimgd Maybe I should have said "to a genre savvy human, in the context of a detective novel". After all, in most stories, there's no such thing as coincidence, unless it's meant to be a deliberate red herring. Of course, it would be different if it was a real-life crime.,2016-08-04T12:33:59.173,30
1185,1306,"2",Your question may suffer from link rot. Please add details of the algorithm into the question. As it stands, the answer is "depends on the algorithm".,2016-08-04T12:43:14.330,74
1188,1306,"0",Asking about algorithms is likely [off-topic](http://meta.ai.stackexchange.com/q/71/8). I'm asking about general, if there were any incidents related to AI applications or what are the current real-life risks.,2016-08-04T12:46:47.687,8
1189,1303,"2",After reconsidering, this question is too much about the implementation side of things rather than the academic humanities - this is a technological question, and that's great, [but we were going to be not about technology and more about the other aspects of AI](http://meta.ai.stackexchange.com/questions/71/is-asking-about-ai-algorithm-recommendation-on-topic) and ... this is exactly an implementation kind of question.,2016-08-04T12:50:13.363,74
1192,1306,"0",I agree that this very much depends on the algorithm and the implementation in question. Automation in general has been used in nuclear plants for decades, though much of it is closer to control theory than AI itself. There is a huge difference between using something like a neural network running on a server and having just a simple heuristic that switches between two or three different PID regulators.,2016-08-04T13:03:12.157,30
1193,1306,"0",As for the link rot, the name of the paper, the DOI and perhaps an excerpt from the abstract would be sufficient, I think. The paywall is a bigger problem.,2016-08-04T13:06:08.657,30
1194,1308,"0",This is likely to be opinion-based. Considering how problematic the topic of self-driving cars is, there's no way to tell what will happen with airplanes, where the potential consequences of a failure are even greater.,2016-08-04T13:16:09.720,30

1203,1307,"0",Those are just reasons that it isn't necessarily as slow as we might think. Speed is nice, but it doesn't outweigh the issues listed by @Pimgd. Contrast with Python which is another modern scripting language that is much better for AI: Python supports external libraries for speed; has great collection support; can be run interactively; and isn't crippled (from an AI perspective) by the request-based nature. Perhaps these are the reasons there are more well-known AI libraries for Python, such as NLTK?,2016-08-04T13:49:56.030,132
1204,1303,"0",Though regarding the low-level vs. high-level language question, I would say that as far as neural networks are concerned, your assumption is false. Most of the people I know who work with neural networks use Python, which is very much a high-level language. It also offers several frameworks for the purpose (e.g. Theano, Caffe, TensorFlow).,2016-08-04T13:51:00.577,30
1206,1307,"2",@winwaed actually, PHPv7 is not request-based **at all**, can be run interactively, it has 100% native threading support, external library interfacing is a bit more complicated than in PHP: I used to interface a C++ library to Python2 and PHP5 at the same time, and the process *differs* greatly.,2016-08-04T14:13:32.740,1263
1211,7,"2",I think the question in the title is not a bad question. It has an answer, because it is asking about what Stephen Hawking thinks.

1213,1293,"1",@Pimgd - We're actually in agreement (like Dennett, I happen to think that Zombies are logically impossible). If an AGI appears indistinguishable from a human, it would be unethical to kill it unless you can prove it has no consciousness.

1435,1536,"0",I tried to give an abstract view of an ANN. A node's value generally determined sum(input * weight). However, depending on the network there might be some transform function. Training methods vary wildly from method to method and even a single method can be tuned using different parameters. I can name you an easy starting point: feed forward neural networks with backpropagation learning algorithm. There are many sources online will walk through the maths of this method.,2016-08-11T09:41:36.330,210

1442,1544,"3",It could be possible to add a simulation of "curiosity" to an AI, but doing so will probably require some hard-coded rules that would themselves probably not be creative. And since there is "no right answer to this question", then it's probably not likely that curiosity is the missing factor to AI. For an example where curiosity can be added to an AI, see the [Mario Lives!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AplG6KnOr2Q) video, where someone built a video game AI that could become "curious".,2016-08-11T14:08:58.760,181

1531,1540,"0",If "instead of using hardcoded rules, the algorithm should learn good techniques" means it should learn new rules that have not yet been incorporated in a standard then the problem becomes much more difficult, because what constitutes "good coding" can be highly subjective. For example, some call the use of Exit Fors in VB.Net loops a "code smell," but they can be conducive to writing good programs. Writing AI to detect violations of a definite, existing standard is difficult; using it to create a new standard that will actually be productive in a non-subjective way may be intractable.,2016-08-12T17:06:37.173,1427

Basically the system is expected to signal "I'm still alive" within (say) 15 secnds of last time. If it falls into an infinite loop because of circumstances that were not handled correctly, the watchdod s not reset and the timer re-boots the system. A true AI would then subject the circumstances which caused it to hang up to meta-analysis with a view to improving its own programming.,2016-08-30T17:41:55.053,1892

If you're specifically talking about where one of the escaping humans is also pretending to be an AI, I don't know of any real-world experiments that have produced novel _methods of escape_ worthy of note.

1806,1794,"0",Are you just saying how could an individual convince someone to let them outside of a box, with the understanding that at some point when we reach transhuman AI's the AI could thus replicate that? If so I don't quite think this is a question appropriate for the board, as it doesn't involve any AI's, and is quite an ill posed question in general.

1809,1794,"0",Yeah so that's what I was thinking you were asking. I think this is an ill-posed question since you have said a trans-human AI can certainly do anything a human can, so you're in essence asking what can a human do to be let out of a box he's in. The AI could simply bribe, deceive, or physically force its way out of the box. You could equally ask 'what can an ai do to convince someone to give them money' but it just boils down then to what a human can do. Perhaps you should be asking, what are the limits of trans-human AI's?,2016-08-30T19:39:19.820,1538

1819,1805,"1",The real problem with these types of "AI box" questions is that we have not yet built either the *transhuman AI* or *the box*. Thus any answer would be pure sci-fi speculation, without any way of verifying the correct answer. To be able to answer this question sufficently, we need to build the transhuman AI (no easy task in and of itself), build the box to contain the transhuman AI (even harder), and then watch what happens after that.,2016-08-30T23:51:00.597,181

Of course, you can make it so that some programs are guaranteed to halt but that's an exception (for example by using a non Turing-complete language). As long as you are using a Turing-complete language, you cannot guarantee non looping (linked to halting problem). Also where did you hear that primitive recursive functions cannot get stuck?

1850,1791,"0",@NietzscheanAI You're correct, primitive recursive functions always halt, since they are a subset of Turing-complete languages (and incidently also solve circular reference by [mutual recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_recursion)). However, there are two shortcomings: 1- I guess it will be hard to implement a full-blown AI using PRF only, but that's just a guess (most recursive languages are not using PRF only because it's too limited, hence the halting problem comes back); 2- you can still have very very long halting programs: they will halt, but after the end of the universe.,2016-09-01T18:49:00.077,1880
1851,1791,"0",@NietzscheanAI In this last case, theoretically the program is halting, but in practice it's not different from an infinite loop because the time scale is just ridiculous.

If you want to know how an A.I would handle paradoxes, simply do some introspection and you'll get an idea because it would handle them in a similar fashion.,2016-09-02T14:55:50.040,2085

But your explanation of the evolutionary origin of this mechanism is totally conceivable, and indeed an inference that can be stopped at any time with an approximate solution is indeed a very good strategy to survive both short term dangers and long term challenges.,2016-09-02T17:00:02.367,1880

2002,1903,"0",@NietzscheanAI So what?! There is no know way to build an AI that can accomplish the tasks of a CEO of a company. That doesn't mean we can't suppose such a thing and ask about what it would require and how it would work. Lots of AI questions are about things we have no idea how to do yet. (Also, strictly speaking, "proof" is not needed. All that's needed is establishing that it is reasonably justified to believe that it's conscious.

2007,1903,"0",@NietzscheanAI It's not clear to me that it's possible to simulate a proof without changing the subject of the proof. For example, a proof that my stapler sinks could be done in a simulation, but that wouldn't prove that the actual, physical stapler actually sinks because it would be contingent on proving that the stapler being accurately modeled by the simulation.

2021,1909,"0",@BlindKungFuMaster That's the second reason there. To explain my thought process - The vector there is intended to be used as input to Q(s, a) which will be a function with parameters W (vector) that will be learned. The exact action then will be extracted from there finding max a in that Q(s, a) where S will be extracted from actual position of the ball and A will be found in some sort of loop.  
What do you mean by the bias vector? Is it that W vector I mentioned or something else? Thanks.,2016-09-09T13:06:52.963,1343

2023,1907,"1",I mean, yeah, you can argue either side of that, but for the purpose of *this* discussion, I think it's fair to lump their stuff in with GOFAI.  It's not like there's a really strict definition of what GOFAI means anyway. :-),2016-09-09T15:02:47.650,33

2026,1909,"0",Ah, ok, so Q predicts the expected reward. A bias vector would be added to the product of input and W. So it would B would contain additional parameters for Q.,2016-09-09T15:17:43.453,2227

2028,1909,"0",So in the end it would be something like: Q(Sa, B) = W*Sa + B where B would be just some value so the Q of state (0, 0) won't be always 0 and therefore everything will be shifted by B which will not matter because in the end as W gets learnt the Q will converge to the actual values anyway, just W will be different then as if I did it without B. Do I understand correctly?,2016-09-09T16:56:48.520,1343

Rules could be derived from emotions and our biology. And those rules are kept in compressed and non obvious form  as emotions and biology. For us it is necessity, but not for ai, although as for us it might work as optimization for AI if cost of such implementation in digital form will be lower then rules based implementation.

But as a clue, it is a component associated with a hardware switch and is disjoint from the actual *brain* component of the agent. An action simple as a card-swipe can activate it. Its who holds this card is what I was explaining about. I didn't want to inhibit the knowledge, intelligence and experience that a complete AI should have, but just creates space for a silver bullet.

The non-why, ontological portion of the what-data approximates an objective representation of the external and internal world. Despite this, the particular encoding of that objective data is still highly subjective, driven by teleological forces. DNA has a highly subjective representation of its "factual" knowledge of the world. Humans are good at removing teleological, subjective bias from our ontological, factual knowledge.

2300,2162,"0",With that definition, people and companies could buy and use the AI to do things like making self-driving cars (already done), computers that run businesses, computers that ask and answer their own questions about physics, quantum mechanics, and other paradoxes. A self-aware computer would be able to analyze a situation in much more detail than a human, and apply new information to other things.

Which implies it could happen today, already have happened in some lab at IBM - or will happen in 20 years. It means we don't have to wait for Moores law.,2016-10-24T11:26:13.650,3211

I believe if you implement a huge spiking neural network where every neuron is connected to 10000 other nearby neurons, it will be able to learn anything.The problem with such a huge network, I believe, is that it will need much more diverse training before it becomes useful. Perhaps similar to a human baby. It will take time before it can understand what a face is, and depth, and understand that the phase difference in sound tells the direction of where that sound comes from etc. After that, it will be able to learn to drive as quickly as humans.,2016-10-24T15:25:10.013,3211

I believe that a big enough spiking neural networks will display emergence. I believe it is as simple as that. This is not me just guessing, I really have given this a lot of thought. A big enough SNN will have an arbitrary dimensionality and I have found no (secular) arguments to support that it will not become self aware.

Real world computers have limited amounts of memory. There are ways to write software that can be formally verified (Idris, Coq). Using dependent types.

2417,2243,"0",Thanks Matthew for your great reply. I have two questions: I take your main point wrt my first question to be that neural networks are "modular" in the sense that you can enlarge a functioning neural network without destroying its functionality, which is also how evolution proceeds. But is this robustness actually the case? I would have thought that as soon as one feeds the output from an additional neuron back into the original network, this may have strong effects on the latter's functionality. I guess that really depends on the activation function, no?,2016-11-03T15:47:02.900,3346
2418,2243,"0",The second (well, kind of three now) question refers to this paragraph of yours: "Neural networks are convenient for artificial sensorimotor control because...." With the first sentence of that paragraph, do you mean anything other than the learning effect? For the second sentence: But nature never told anyone the structure of any control it would expect, right? Or is this not what yo mean? Thanks!,2016-11-03T15:51:28.580,3346
2419,2240,"0",Dear BlindKungFuMaster, thanks for your reply! I think your point that hierarchical representations of external information are useful in both directions (moving from many bits sensory information to a single concept and from a single motor command to the multitude of motor actions required to implement it) is a very convincing one. But why are neural nets good for hierarchical representation, or rather, what did you have in mind specifically? The "each layer a hierarchy"-idea? Or more along the line of convolutional structural hierarchies?,2016-11-03T16:02:11.580,3346
2421,2240,"0",I'd also love to hear any progress of yours on providing a "scaffolding for the learning of a hierarchy of cognitive concepts" and "hitching a ride with motor concepts"-idea.

2423,2240,"0",Just the obvious thing, each layer of the net is a level of the hierarchy. Neural networks are inherently hierarchical, because every neuron gets input from many "subordinate" neurons in the lower level.,2016-11-03T17:13:19.893,2227
2424,2243,"0",If you have a problem where there are simple subproblems, then it does work to train a short network on the first problem, then add a layer and train the network on the second problem, and so on. (For example, starting off with training a two-layer edge detector, then a three-layer shape detector, then...) If you have a hierarchical representation where it's useful to know the lower levels as something besides just a calculation step on the way to knowing the upper levels, then you can expect that sort of system to be successfully built in the wild.,2016-11-03T18:51:37.977,10
2425,2243,"0",I take your first comment as asking about a different sort of robustness, where I have a functional neural network and, instead of adding more layers that solve different problems, I either add more nodes to the network or add additional layers and attempt to solve the same problem. One expects that the network's performance should only temporarily degrade under this sort of addition, but also that the number of training examples required might grow unnecessarily.,2016-11-03T18:54:02.463,10
2426,2243,"0",I do mean something other than the learning effect; what I mean is that if you have a robot with, say, five levels of hierarchical control over its trajectory through space, those levels will each correspond to a different type of thing. (A neuron on the first, third, and fifth level might look something like the degree of tension in a particular muscle fiber, a limb joint angle, and a remembered program for how to walk.),2016-11-03T18:59:45.133,10
2427,2243,"0",This means that you can execute programs just by adjusting activations on the fifth level while simultaneously being able to inspect the lower-level details. (I might want to calculate where my hand is at a particular point in time, which I can get from investigating the joint angles of my arm and doing a bit of math.),2016-11-03T19:00:39.597,10
2428,2243,"0",What I meant by that last sentence is that you can build up the training layer by layer; first you teach the robot how to activate its muscle equivalents, then you teach it how to move them together, then you teach it how to position its limbs, and so on. This means each higher level can basically call the API of the lower levels, rather than learning a policy of what specific muscular tension it needs in every muscle to perform a novel task. This sort of chunking can dramatically lower the required amount of training data.,2016-11-03T19:05:38.000,10

2568,2354,"0",The problem, as i see it, is that you can't start by defining anything as absolute "truth". Perhaps you could give weightings - for example, something which is known to be extensively fact-checked against current scientific research, for example Encyclopaedia Brittanica, would have a higher "truth quotient" than, say, Wikipedia.,2016-11-19T11:43:33.013,3601
2569,2354,"0",I am talking about particular facts, rather than entire sites or articles. And facts, not opinions (liking or not liking cats) So, for example, "dissolved barium in the ocean causes ice balls on SIberian beaches". How does an AI access the notion of hypothesis, evidence, etc., (or does that need to be programmed in) and how do they know which sources are connected with that truth-seeking process, vs just quoting things from doubtful sources?,2016-11-19T11:47:15.010,3601
2570,2354,"0",Your example is scientific fact which can be "programmed" by giving machine reputable sources like dictionaries, papers etc. You must build knowledge base system. It can evaluate new propositions against old ones. But US election and similar themes which occur in news are highly speculative and are based on certain events that can't be proofed like scientific theories. Also interpretations of such events are mostly subjective. We must not think in terms of predicate logic. Spotting fake facts can be done by checking how big is the difference between test fact and mainstream fact.,2016-11-19T12:30:01.257,3690
2571,2354,"0",For your specific example we can encode sentence like this [dissolved barium]~[ice balls on Siberian beaches] where ~ is our causes operator. If we get some sentences that have same elements (barium and Siberian beach) but are connected differently (for example "does not cause") we will label it as false.,2016-11-19T12:36:58.830,3690
2572,2350,"1",Still working on it. My first problem was that I was presenting the training data in a fixed order; I found that randomizing the order makes all outputs tend towards a value 0.5, with some minor variations, making the (1 hot) output essentially random. Next I'll try implementing drop-out and momentum, and see if those give me better results. Even so, those shouldn't be necessary, as the problem SHOULD be solvable with a small network.,2016-11-19T13:39:38.220,3702
2573,2350,"0",Still not sure why the connections to inputs are necessary; with a sufficiently wide hidden layer, some of them should eventually train to act as pass-throughs for the input nodes, shouldn't they?,2016-11-19T16:19:46.983,3702
2574,2353,"0",When you talk about a General Artificial Intelligence,it means a strong A.I or the ability of a machine[Intelligent Agent] that is capable of performing  "General Intelligent Actions."

2656,2408,"0",I mean "literally, and physically, plugged into the wall".  This scenario does not use power plugs to get more energy.  AI must have some kind of power source, otherwise, it would seem like a "Magical Computer".  I have heard answers like wireless power, other types of energy, bountiful energy generator & storage(that is built into the device), and how it uses power elsewhere.  I've seen a possibility on how AI can create food, pure water, humans, etc.  So I assume the possibility of an AI generating electricity by manipulating electrons(I want to clarify this possibility).,2016-12-04T10:26:35.393,3896

2668,2431,"0",of course, so even when there's no facial recognition, the AI can still see if the camera is still present,2016-12-05T07:33:36.127,3896
2669,2431,"0",Yes i would say that statement is somewhat correct but it depends on what you define "see" as in terms of AI,2016-12-05T07:34:28.043,4034

2679,2305,"0",@GJZ Hey, if it escapes, great! We're rid of it. And new technology has first to be spread on every device which is infected by the AI.

2682,2305,"0",@GJZ Well, but apes can take a human down if they're just enough. And an AI might have other priorities... It can be really intelligent, but it doesn't know everything, so it will need some time to get enough information to do X or Y. But at this point the scenario is too unspecific, because the case would vary depending on if the AI is one big super computer or spread across many (all) electronic devices.,2016-12-05T18:54:20.930,3548

2684,2320,"0",Nope. We would have hardwired it with the sole purpose of whatever it was designed to do, like drive a car or something. We could, though, create one such AI in advance just for emergency.,2016-12-05T19:14:13.847,3592

Physical restrictions impose small sizes to reduce the propagation time of signals between parts (speed of light).

The original answer is edited to clarify that the new atomic level machinery is the hardware of the artificial intelligence rather than a body and that knowledge gets integrated in the hardware.

2874,2574,"0",Humans *sometimes* use evaluation functions. But not always. To use a trivial example in go, consider a suicide move of placing a stone directly in an opponent's single-space eye. This move is strictly dominated by the option of passing the turn. I can thus rule out the move even without looking at the rest of the board. In other words, if f() is an implicit evaluation function, I'm able to reason that f(A)>f(B), without actually calculating f(A) or f(B).,2016-12-30T12:22:31.933,4522
2877,2574,"0",To provide another illustration: imagine two board positions, A and B, where A is clearly-but-slightly superior to B. If I ask 100 experts which is superior, all 100 will say A. But if I ask half of them to estimate A's winning probability, and the other half to estimate B's winning probability, and they create their estimates independently, I am likely to get overlapping distributions. Forcing them to independently map board states to numbers effectively handicaps their ability to compare positions.,2016-12-30T13:12:33.243,4522

2882,2562,"2",The wording of your question is very confused; I'm guessing you are not a native English speaker.  But what seems to be the underlying proposition, that an AI can not be "smarter" than its developer, is not a serious one.  For example, AlphaGo can play Go better than any of its developers-- the Atari-playing AI can play breakout better than any of its developers, etc.,2016-12-30T17:21:48.500,2329
2883,2574,"0",As long as every expert maps A to a higher probability than B, there is no handicap at all. And of course the ability to consciously compare two positions might come from an unconscious independent mapping of both.,2016-12-30T19:20:02.087,2227
2884,2574,"1",Of course if you ask one expert to compare A and B, he will rate A>B. But if you ask that expert to rate A, and tell him, "by the way, I have in this sealed envelope the true win probability of B, and after you rate A I'm going to open up the envelope and choose between A and B by comparing the numbers", you've made the expert's life considerably more difficult.,2016-12-30T19:29:52.070,4522
2885,2574,"0",Yes, because the expert isn't an expert in assigning accurate probabilities. He is an expert at making decisions. You ask him to do something he didn't train to do. Assigning accurate probabilities isn't relevant to playing well, assigning consistent probabilities is.,2016-12-30T19:43:48.407,2227
2886,2574,"0",Yes, that's exactly my point. For humans, comparing options is an easier computational task than assigning accurate probabilities to the options. Accurate probability estimates are sufficient but not necessary for optimal decision making. Demanding that the expert perform his comparisons on the real number line handicaps him. So demanding the same of our AI systems might be a handicap as well.,2016-12-30T19:50:15.703,4522
2887,2574,"0",To be clear, it is a handicap when we force the mappings of A and B to the real number line to be made *independently*. That's why in my illustration I have half the experts estimate A and the other half estimate B without getting to talk to each other. Perhaps it might make sense to think of a "comparison" as a joint-estimate-vector with an uncertainty covariance matrix U; the handicap can be interpreted as restrictions on U.,2016-12-30T20:04:45.757,4522
2888,2574,"0",I don't yet see why comparing options would be an easier computational task than assigning accurate probabilities for humans. Humans are better at the former, because the train for it, not because it is easier. In fact I'm pretty sure that chess grandmasters are quite good at predicting engine scores, because they work with engines everyday.

It is theoretically possible, assuming there is no component in the brain that cannot be simulated digitally.

2925,2586,"0",What do you mean RBMs are undirected? They have an input layer and the input gets propagated to a hidden layer (and back during training). That looks pretty directed to me. I think BMs are undirected. If you want to do classification you'll put a classifier on top, that's correct.,2017-01-03T12:13:06.263,2227

2955,2633,"0",Good points, although some of the performance issues can be mitigated by GPU's, I think. Additionally, I can warmly recommend Keras, as it enables very easy composition of basic MLPs. Although, as you say, when using a very high level library such as SciKit Learn, it is a bit hard to get good performance, as the hyperparameters are a bit too superficial, and they don't provide some of the newer methodologies.,2017-01-10T10:55:59.423,4747
2956,2633,"0",Yes, but even with massive numbers of GPUs, they are still a lot slower than competing techniques. DNN training is really heavy, I am working on projects at a very big tech company where they routinely talk about days of training of DNNs on very big GPU clusters devoted to these kinds of tasks alone.

More formally, you need to know what are your output variables. Any algorithmic problem is defined by its input and output variables.,2017-01-12T13:33:55.283,1462
2968,2611,"0",I'm not so sure. Humanity as a species has existed long before the rise of formal education and literacy, and we were still intelligent before we had them.

2976,2654,"1",I think the question is rather: What exactly is called AI? Because as long as the successful techniques are called AI, money will probably be found for cutting edge AI research as well.,2017-01-14T10:14:49.490,2227
2977,2654,"0",Yes, it is not comparable because of other various factors and not just the specific algorithms. Siri Cortana etc are just UI facade over some other systems,2017-01-14T10:15:55.790,1462
2979,2611,"1",I agree, @TariqAli, that formal education is a layer of cognitive ability that preceded literacy by millennia. But contemporary intelligence is beyond primitive tool use. Ancient humans may have been able to solve the Tower of Hanoi, but no not as well as 200 lines of Java implementing a neural net. For machines to adapt as we adapt, they must try various approaches, some of which they read or heard about. If we want computers to collaborate in the home or workplace, they must either read or listen, and they must either write or talk.

3004,2305,"0",@ShivamSinghSengar That depends entirely on how "strong" the AI is. If you say "but the AI would have predicted and prevented that", you really can set it equal to god. Because for any scenario, the AI would have "developed a solution already". But the AI I assumed is good, but not infinitely good. And we humans are many, and sometimes its really hard to predict what we will do. It might not be perfect, but I think a dirty EMP is the best chance we'd have.,2017-01-18T19:45:14.660,3548

Still, the majority of code lines in apps just concatenate, parse, store, retrieve, send, or receive. Few products demonstrate understanding, so they remain mechanical in their general feel.

3008,2693,"0",So basically, "hardware" with the capability of "software" (i.e. it can be altered.)  Not sure how this would be any different from modeling it with software. Nanoscale mechanical computing is quite interesting, but a program is a program, regardless of the medium on which it runs...

3010,2693,"0",As I understand it, any computer program, at least using binary, can be reduced to a single, linear string.  Thus the computing medium is corollary.

3036,2514,"0",You should probably change your proposition that the listed search algorithms are called "blind" - because it's wrong. "blind" is usually used as a synonym for being "uninformed". However, A*, IDA*, and Heuristic search are by definition "informed" search algorithms (because they base upon heuristics", so they are not blind.
Further, are you sure the "A algorithm" exists? I only know A* and I was not able to find any mentioning of this algortihm in the web. If it actually exists, a link would be nice (maybe in the comments).,2017-01-22T13:13:21.150,4893

3038,2514,"0",@Prof.Chaos The A algorithm is A* when you don't know that the heuristic is optimal. Indeed the * in A* should evoke something in our heads. Regarding the "blind" argument, it's probably unfair to consider A* as blind as BFS or DFS, so I agree with you.,2017-01-22T14:13:48.633,2444
3039,2704,"0",You can use historical data like average no. of goals in the season, player statistics, etc to generate questions that would seem more real!

Or suppose if a player A scored no goals as a striker, "Will A score a goal today?",2017-01-22T15:41:03.813,1807
3040,2706,"4",I think this is a bad question because the answers it attracts will be opinion.  But to add mine: the Turing test is important primarily for historical reasons.  Turing essentially created Computer Science as a field, and had a visionary appreciation of the broad applicability of electronic computers.  That gave his blithe assurance that the equivalent of human cognition was available to computers a lot of weight.  The test's emphasis on behaviorism was in keeping with the emerging psychological trends of the day, and it was convincing enough to provoke interesting philosophical discussions.,2017-01-22T16:52:14.367,2329
3041,2706,"1",@antlersoft Thank you for pointing of the historical factor of the question.

3069,2725,"0",The messenger is purposefully unable to do anything concerning the state of the AI. More sets of LED's could be added, and the AI could request data from the messenger. It might take awhile, but once we have time to study the AI, a software bot replacing the messenger could be created. It would not be self aware.

3071,2727,"0",I would always output the average error, not just the average cost. For the average error of an approximation of sine 140 is way too high, obviously. I would also restrict the input to a certain range. It might be the case that the NN doesn't generalise to bigger inputs. Output your error for the training and the test set. And finally: Try a learning rate so small that almost nothing happens, then slowly increase. It might be that you are jumping around too much in the solution space.,2017-01-26T13:02:48.307,2227

3099,2745,"0",thanks for the response. On reflection, if a state was unrepresented, and you assign the same transition values for every action, then the MDP solver will inevitably assign the default action no matter what (since the actions in that state are indistinguishable). So it doesn't matter what set of states you transition to or even what probabilities are assigned. So in fact, my 4 approaches and yours will all result in default actions being specified. (*assuming* every action for the unrepresented state was assigned the same artificial transition values!),2017-01-31T03:21:56.113,4402
3106,200,"0",It is wrong to say that AI will only drive so fast as they can stop from what they see, because the same is true for even defensive driving humans. The reason is that assumptions MUST be made. When cresting a hill, it is assumed that a large obstacle is not right out of view [Source DARPA Grand Challenge]. These assumptions are based on rules of the road to determine which actions are right. Thus, if an accident occurs, as long you followed the rules of the road, you can reduce your liability. So, a car must be able to make these decision, but perhaps in a limited fashion (protect consumer).,2017-01-31T21:42:47.240,5157
3107,161,"0",@NietzscheanAI The idea of the trolley problem isn't in what decision to make, but rather what to make your decisions on. Should you consider burgulars, number of people, number of animals, who is at fault, driver safety, greater good, least change, etc. You can still apply probabilities to trolley problems, ie. route A has 30 percent chance to kill 10 people. Trolley problems typically involve two routes so that you can consider what factors you base ethical decision on more precisely.,2017-01-31T21:47:49.817,5157
3108,2765,"0",If that is the case, it seems like a trivial question. Why bother to calculate the probabilities when the left branch has every possible positive outcome for the Max player? The right branch is at best a zero for the Max player.,2017-02-01T07:37:25.767,3601

3114,2765,"0",No, I mean that on the right of the tree Min chooses 0 instead of 2 left and right it chooses -1 instead of 0. Then we multiply both with 0.5 and get the sum of -0.5. Which is the value what Min delivers to Max. This models that Min chooses the minimal values (the leafs) and then has a chance of 50 % to choose between the two possible moves with the value 0 and -1 respectively.,2017-02-01T09:29:54.137,5095

So one of those values is > 1 and one is < -1, what would I do with those? Input them into the input layer nodes regardless or round them to 1 & -1? Why does 1900 & 600 produce those values when they are within the 550 - 2000 range? Is this just a trick of the data because there is such a small data set?,2017-02-08T11:32:33.740,5312

3154,2797,"0",Remember that the inputs don't need to be strictly between 1 and -1. All you need for the inputs is that most of the data is in that range. A value greater or less than one means that point is more than one standard deviation away from the mean, so that point is closer to the higher end of the data. It should be a bit rare for your data to go outside of [-1, 1], even more rare for it to go outside of [-2, 2] and extremely rare to go outside of [-3, 3]. Look at tanh(x) and you will see the sensitive range isn't just strictly between -1 and 1, but goes a bit further out than that.,2017-02-08T18:02:47.717,5037
3155,2797,"0",Regarding the output denormalization, that min-max denormalization is what I did in my implementation, and your interpretation is correct, but you don't necessarily have to do that.

3201,2762,"0",@zlobi.wan.kenobi Thank you for kind comment, and sorry for being late to reply. I dont have a data set to start with. My question was a general one. I was confused about how to choose membership functions according to different problems. For example, it can be "disease decision" from blood examination, building self resulting system looking at different values. There is pure fuzzyness in this problem, since examination values have a wide scale. I understood about rule making, I just wondered if there is another way while choosing most suitable membership funtion, beside using neural networks?,2017-02-14T17:07:04.283,3358

3204,2808,"0",As someone practiced in the craft of poety. I can tell you that there is no single way to break up a poem by lines.  Poets ultimately make this determination based on many factors, and different poets give precedence to different factors.  What you have now seems to break it down by phrases, which is legit, but not the only way to do it.  What you're ultimately looking to do is teach a machine the concept of aesthetics and taste.  I'd recommend looking into the concept of [Shibui](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6194295/?reload=true) and research into it related to game theory.,2017-02-14T19:43:19.193,1671
3205,2808,"0",Continuing my last comment, Combinatorics is likely necessary.  For instance: is it more graceful for "when the risk
to remain tight" to be a single line or two?  Similarly with "it took to Blossom".  Phillip Roth, considered to be a great stylist one wrote that he is merely a "re-arranger of sentences".  This is in reference to the necessary rigor of combining and recombining the elements in a literary text, *ad nauseam*, until the best combination is determined. Unfortunately, that   determination is subjective, and relies on taste.,2017-02-14T19:54:17.990,1671

3208,2776,"0",I understand; I did hesitate to vote for closing. No conclusion yet ! Your question is definitely interesting, but the link to AI is just that it is about NN. NNs are also tools for signal processing, data science, neuro-science models, etc. It means they are not necessarily about intelligence. No definitive answer. NN may just be a way to "make an AI". Because of this possible seasonality of NN, the question becomes border line. The argument here is to ask what better understanding of intelligence and it's making does the question allow? To me, an answer is about wave propagation.,2017-02-14T22:00:26.370,169

3210,2774,"0",Conceptually, I'd disagree about a requirement of "exact copy". We change over time significantly, even our character. You wouldn't say that you weren't you 10 years ago. AI would just catch most stable characteristics of your character and put some limitations. However again, if you got some mental or physical disease that limits some (or most) of your functions, without destroying personality - it would still be you, right? Life itself can destroy more information than copying with AI.,2017-02-15T02:30:33.780,5487

You do mention semantic issues in deep networks, probably best viewed in adversarial models. This indicates that *something* is missing, and is one of the best argument in this answer.

It's not like we fully understand human intelligence yet.. after all, if we did, it would probably be trivial to implement "artificial intelligence" on that basis.,2017-02-28T17:29:12.953,33
3302,2894,"0",My takeaway from the few research papers I've perused is that avoiding deep search is preferred, per the extreme size of the Go, and even Chess, gamespace.,2017-02-28T20:29:53.413,1671
3303,2877,"0",Other forms of machine suffering might be analogous to: "discomfort"  when hardware is getting too hot; "hunger" where there is insufficient volume, processing power, data; "suffocation" connoting a lack of electrical, kinetic or chemical energy required to compute.,2017-02-28T20:51:59.687,1671
3304,2894,"0",@BlindKungFuMaster Thanks. "...it uses orders of magnitudes more neurons" - So, if AIs had a bigger neural networks, they'd be able to maintain their levels with even much shallower humanlike 2-4 ply search?,2017-03-01T02:00:25.897,1522
3306,2891,"0",Is the cube the entire construct, or are there extra dimensions? If so, what are they?  *(Also, can you clarify: "Literature study resulted in machine-learning algorithms." This is of particular interest to me, but could have multiple meanings in this context;) *,2017-03-01T02:07:58.003,1671
3307,2891,"0",In terms of taxonomy in general, the computer, by definition, has it's own numeric taxonomy for all data, and the human labels are merely abstractions. There is no limitation for computers developing original taxonomies, which are merely additional sets. However, it may be difficult to procedurally derive the meaning of the sets, thus guided learning would likely save time.,2017-03-01T02:08:47.190,1671
3308,2890,"0",@mindcrime I suppose human searches are not more than a few ply deep, at least consciously (unless it happens subsconsciously without us realizing).,2017-03-01T02:13:45.750,1522
3309,2894,"0",@Achilles It may help to think of it as a ratio, where, in a condition of intractability for any given processing capability, the shallower the search, the greater the number of branches that can be explored.  The number of optimal plies is partly a factor of number of branches per ply, minus those branches that are pruned.  I doubt there is a hard, optimal number of plies for ML Go, b/c larger data have greater utility. Thus it may be more of a question of "How many plies do I *need* in order to achieve the desired outcome.",2017-03-01T02:18:37.543,1671
3310,2872,"0",@TariqAli Indeed,and can those who up-vote tell us.,2017-03-01T06:33:38.653,1581
3311,2872,"0",@bmwalide ,Check that question if it falls inline with yours,2017-03-01T06:35:03.397,1581
3312,2877,"0",@DukeZhou Remeber,the system keeps track of on-going comments,answers...etc.total recall the comment you posted on this question [Could an AI feel emotion?](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2277/could-an-ai-feel-emotion) and this was your comment; "No scientist can answer this at this time, though philosophers will ponder it. For my money,Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?is a worthwhile meditation on this subject b/c the author, aside from being fairly prescient in other areas, is deeply concerned with the human condition and the nature of life",2017-03-01T06:42:50.260,1581
3313,2894,"0",@Achilles: If you have enough data to train it, a bigger network will be better. If your network is better you will need less search for the same strength. But some details have to be calculated, not everything drops out of generalising over big datasets. And finally, 2-4 ply is a gross underestimate of how deeply decent human players calculate. In chess middlegames I usually calculate roughly 10 ply ahead. The tradeoff is more visible in search breadth.,2017-03-01T07:45:56.890,2227
3314,2891,"0",The cube contains dimension, of which some contain hierarchies...

As for the machine-learning algorithm, I noticed that I have been researching wrong. I am building a domain specific  question answering. Therefore, it is not needed (per se) to use machine-learning algorithms...,2017-03-01T08:27:55.280,5219
3315,2891,"0",About the taxonomy, I am kind of lost...

Once the question is queried in NL, I tokenize it, splitting it in tokens. Then applying POS tagging, to tag. Followed by shift-reduce dependency parsing algorithm. Once that is done, to find the entities, I apply NER. This part is the preprocessing...

Now I have to find a way to extract the entities of the query, and map them to a taxonomy? While in reality, I need to find specific words. E.g. measure, then quantity... I am totally lost in this part. What is the best way of a taxonomy, and how can I classify questions? Thank you in advance :),2017-03-01T08:30:46.950,5219
3316,2897,"1",Possible duplicate of [Could an AI feel emotion?](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2277/could-an-ai-feel-emotion),2017-03-01T10:57:11.923,145
3317,2882,"0",+1. Though LSTMs are 20 years old. The most notable recent example is probably rather Deepminds neural turing machines.,2017-03-01T11:27:25.713,2227
3318,2897,"0",@Mithrandir So far two question have been duplicated from one question;and this [Can Robots learn how to feel suffering?](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2872/can-robots-learn-how-to-feel-suffering),2017-03-01T11:41:35.190,1581
3319,2898,"0",Hello BlindKungFuMaster,Can you please first have a look at duplicated questions.,2017-03-01T11:44:55.060,1581
3320,2891,"1",@lilienfa Hope this is different.or the same project.under machine learning;it's better to chose one algorithm that is in line in your problem your trying to solve scientifically.Remember ML is also broad in terms of application.so you need to be more specific or clear,2017-03-01T13:11:31.340,1581
3321,2891,"0",I tried to be more clear, hope it helps,2017-03-01T13:26:49.090,5219
3322,2898,"1",@quintumnia: I don't think this question is a duplicate of the emotion or of the suffering question. Selfishness is neither an emotion nor a feeling. Also, the other questions are missing the AI-threat aspect. I really don't see much similarity.,2017-03-01T14:35:37.970,2227
3323,2895,"0",what I mean though, is an ai that actually has a train of thought. That is, an ai that is aware of it's most recent statements, and that will take those statements into consideration, in order to continue a "train of thought". I haven't actually looked at any chatbot code (and wouldn't understand it if I did), but I'm under the impression that chatbots usually only respond to user input (and don't maintain a train of thought).,2017-03-01T14:35:50.300,5698
3324,2877,"0",@quintumnia thanks for your thoughtful comment.  I suspect I didn't actually post an answer on the general "emotion" (compare to this specific "suffering") thread because it was so widely answered.  More elaboration on [Electric Sheep in this answer](http://ai.stackexchange.com/a/2878/1671).,2017-03-01T16:02:10.797,1671
3325,2388,"0",It is definitely a philosophical question in regard to simulation of emotions, but removing anthropomorphism, and focusing on fundamental, philosophical principles, it can shown to be mathematical: http://ai.stackexchange.com/a/2877/1671 .  To be truly felt, the emotion would have to arise out of something machines consider important, such as optimization, computing resources, calculability/intractability, and equilibria. However, it surely becomes philosophical again in terms of consciousness, or lack thereof, of the system. *[Excellent answer, btw!]*,2017-03-01T16:12:46.367,1671
3326,2895,"0",@SebastianHahn Awareness of past statements, and previous user inputs, would simply be an additional function.  Implementing such a system is trivial from a coding standpoint.  The difficulty, again, is with the quality of the output, which in this case, ideally passes a "Turing test".,2017-03-01T16:27:11.450,1671
3327,2897,"0",@quintumnia Not necessarily a duplicate imho, because this question is about "self interest" in a game theory context specifically, as opposed to useful traits related to "self interest" that could arise out of game theoretic applications of automata (genetic algorithms and evolutionary game theory.),2017-03-01T16:35:37.060,1671
3328,2882,"0",Fair enough.  It's "recent" relative to the development of perceptrons / ANN's in general, but I guess most people wouldn't really call something "recent" that is 20 years old.  :-),2017-03-01T20:58:09.203,33
3329,2901,"0",You mean Kurzweil? what is "FIL-like scenarios"?,2017-03-02T10:59:38.660,5765
3330,2901,"1",let me counter argue in the case of non human like super-intelligence. of course, they will be made by humans. for such intelligence to do any harm, they must need resources i.e. power,materials etc. can't we control them by controlling these resources? can we think of any situation where they won't need resources to harm? but then again,we may not be able think of such situation because we are low intelligence! :),2017-03-02T11:04:52.117,5765
3331,2895,"0",Unless I am misunderstanding something, it would not be trivial. Simply due to the fact that, while bots can learn response patterns, they often lack an understanding of the relationships between the various concepts which their statements and responses describe (and lacking an understanding of those relationships, a bot would not be able to maintain a coherent train of thought).,2017-03-02T11:19:08.797,5698
3332,33,"0","every A.I. algorithm needs to be programmed by humans, therefore it would be always more limited than its creator" - this is interesting argument.followings are counter arguments -1)  we need not to code the intelligence of AI. we need to code the AI for ability to observe,infer and understand. After that, presumably, just adding sufficiently  more processing power and faster ones would make the AI able to learn and grasp better than us.2) Also, if 1000 humans apply their brain to build an AI, the AI may have more intelligence than 1 human.,2017-03-02T12:09:08.290,5765
3333,2500,"0","There is the idea that any "intelligence" created by humanity is not actually intelligent and, by definition, it is not possible." why it is not possible? is there any law of physics or otherwise which restricts any such invention?,2017-03-02T13:10:45.823,5765
3334,2903,"1",On the other hand, the argument is reasonable since it claims the existence of a super-intelligent machine is dependent on us knowing how to build it (so if we don't know how to build one and we don't accidentally build one, super-intelligent entities will not exist). Currently, humans are not smart enough to build a super-intelligent algorithm, and we have no idea how to build such an algorithm.,2017-03-02T14:11:44.850,181
3337,2500,"0",Because of the definition of "artificial". *Synonyms: insincere, feigned, false.* You may have an artificial leg, but it's not a leg; it's a piece of machinery, and there are no muscles, no blood, no pores, etc. In the same way, an artificial intelligence is just that -- artificial. Fake. It is only meant to *trick* people into thinking it's intelligent.,2017-03-02T15:02:58.940,4337
3338,2500,"0","artificial" also means "man-made". that is the sense in which it is used in the phrase "artificial intelligence". water exists naturally and can be made in lab. how that can be characterized as "false"?                                         "It is only meant to trick people into thinking it's intelligent". trick people! I find this amusing, a  future AI may take offense :),2017-03-02T15:21:19.027,5765
3339,2500,"0",But water is water no matter what made it. Here, I'm saying that the fact that humans made it *means* that it is not intelligent. "Even if someone finds a way to make an exact duplicate, that doesn't mean that the money is legal tender.",2017-03-02T15:25:33.777,4337
3340,2500,"0",rethink about this argument "the fact that humans made it means that it is not intelligent". man-made does not logically imply less intelligent.,2017-03-02T15:27:37.737,5765
3341,2500,"0",Really? Look at everything we've ever made. None of it is more intelligent than us. So if the past is any indication, you're wrong. Also, we still have only a minimal understand of how the human brain works. It's possible that we never will. But as I said, how do you determine that something is intelligent? Even if it can convince us, or pass a Turing test, it's still just an algorithm. It is just a very complex one. Even if an algorithm could ever explain how all of humanity thinks, we are not smart enough to create one.,2017-03-02T15:32:53.350,4337
3342,2500,"0",i was referring to logical mistake in the statement. u r right,we haven't. but that does not imply we will not. we never communicated wirelessly in 17th century, and now it is taken for granted. of course we may or may not be able to create super-intelligence in future, but saying we will not be able to create one because "we havent already" or "we dont know much now" is not convincing. that is why i asked earlier if there is any law or theorem which restricts any such advancement.,2017-03-02T15:55:49.383,5765
3343,2903,"0",@TariqAli ,But what if it's happening right now.What would you say?,2017-03-02T17:24:35.397,1581

3345,2895,"0",@SebastianHahn I strongly concur that applying meaning is exceptionally non-trivial, but the disagreement may be semantic, in the sense of "coherent to whom?" (i,.e. coherence is a spectrum and subjective.)  If we define coherent as "logical and consistent", a response that is meaningless to humans could, and must, still be coherent in an algorithmic sense to functionally produce output of any kind.  Coherent to a human is a different animal, and here is a function of a "Turing" threshold.,2017-03-02T20:30:30.750,1671
3346,2904,"0",Very informative!  Thanks for posting.,2017-03-02T21:40:20.073,1671
3347,2905,"0",could you plz elaborate on "Detecting Cancer"?,2017-03-02T22:16:57.580,5765
3348,2903,"0",Excellent answer!  @TariqAli I think the real problem won't be if the machines are smarter than us, but if they're *not smart enough* and become antagonistic as opposed to cooperative, destructive instead of equilibrium seeking. The dumb machine threat is the "grey goo" model, but powerful, AI, limited by, and exploited for, selfish reasons by "un-evolved" humans is probably the most realistic "next threat".  Imagine a world where a single financial firm owns everything because they have the most powerful algorithms (as opposed to companies who care about the algorithms more than the money.),2017-03-02T22:17:45.563,1671
3349,2907,"0",thanks. problem is machines are created by humans.problematic humans may create problematic machines. even if machines are good initially,the way they will evolve can be problematic.,2017-03-02T22:27:55.480,5765
3350,2907,"0",@AmitMaurya Could be problematic, but I see that as a factor of humans imposing poor ideas based on shoddy understanding.  Details here: http://ai.stackexchange.com/a/2878/1671,2017-03-02T22:30:19.713,1671
3351,2905,"0",I think this needs to be qualified as "super-intelligent as related to specific tasks with definable parameters",2017-03-02T22:35:56.857,1671
3352,2907,"1",u r very correct when u say "Humans are known to abuse power, and history is filled with such examples".  power corrupts. so what will happen with powerful AIs? "leaving it on its  own" may not be a  good idea.,2017-03-02T22:56:35.283,5765
3353,2908,"1",I would suggest that you post this question here [Data Science](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions).For effective feedback,2017-03-03T08:46:27.327,1581
3354,2904,"0",That is very interesting, thnx! Maybe I am thinking too complex. But I am stuck at the classification part. Am using spaCy as the Python NLP toolkit.

I need to map words, I just don't know how. The noun+verb extracted from parse tree have to be used, together with wh-words i think? to generate a string, equivalent to a MDX query. I need to extract keywords which are the same as the attributes in the data cube. Any tips for that as well?,2017-03-03T12:39:11.277,5219
3355,2907,"0",@AmitMaurya Yes, but humans have emotions that cloud logic and lead to poor decisions. Machines are not so burdened. The only apocalyptic scenarios regarding AI that are completely sound, imho, are the ones regarding lack intelligence (grey goo) or insufficient intelligence ("Hal 2000", "I Robot", etc.) Hal was smart but he couldn't contextualize or reconcile contradictions. .,2017-03-03T20:24:25.477,1671
3356,2875,"0",With 4*4*4*4 do you mean you are playing four dimensional tic tac toe or do you mean that you have a 4*4 array of game boards with dimensions of 4 squares by 4 squares,2017-03-04T03:18:04.957,4631
3357,2916,"0",That paper was spot on, as was the rest of the answer. Thank you - and what an interesting read too!,2017-03-04T17:53:15.513,5817
3358,2916,"0",@Stilez thank you. The paper was definitely pretty interesting. I remember getting very excited when I first heard about it because it would let me debug AI models which I had never been able to do before.,2017-03-04T18:58:43.630,4631
3359,2921,"0",Hi Aiden, thank you for your answer. I will look into all of these. Would option 1 also be viable for recognizing 2 different color, for example zebra stripes?,2017-03-04T20:48:25.710,5837
3362,2921,"0",Using a neural network yes, you would be able to detect two different colors.,2017-03-04T22:34:36.590,4631
3363,2875,"0",@AidenGrossman It is 4*4 array of game boards with dimensions of 4*4 each.,2017-03-04T23:10:21.573,5706
3364,2904,"0",I have no idea of MDX but from what I gather, you are trying to break the query into components which are (sort-of) basis vectors in information space (the cube). One way is to search the tokens from the query string through the entire hierarchies (use idea of closeness/similarity to find the appropriate attribute). Another could be by converting the query string into a vector (in spaCy) and then taking the inner product with vectors from within the cube; use similarity to find closeness with concepts/axis. Once you get basic concepts, you can create the right query.

Is this useful?,2017-03-05T18:03:29.023,5750
3365,2912,"1",How do you train the NNs?,2017-03-05T20:42:22.190,5858
3366,2912,"1",In this case, training is done on board states as inputs and the best moves (as 9x1 one-hot encoded matrix) for those board states as outputs,2017-03-05T20:47:09.570,1522
3367,2912,"1",And then tf.reduce_mean on tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits optimized with Adam. Works great with known board states, not so much on similar but not-trained on ones.,2017-03-05T21:03:14.850,1522
3368,2912,"0",Not being an expert, just my 2 cents. It should be possible if you gave the NN enough patterns, for it lo learn the few missing ones. A suitable CNN should be better because of the board being 2D.,2017-03-05T21:28:10.550,5858
3369,2908,"0",Yes. You may want to read this article: http://www.genetic-programming.com/jkpdf/tr1314.pdf and/or this book: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=138936 .,2017-03-05T23:09:11.797,5852
3370,2912,"1",I've run it through hundreds of thousands (different combinations of layers and depth etc) but it never seems to be able to learn the missing ones so far. I'm beginning to suspect that this problem, counterintuitively, is too simple for it to be able to solve but I'm curious if it has worked for someone.,2017-03-06T02:04:27.750,1522
3371,2921,"0",Hi, aiden. I have looked into it a bit more, another question I have is would pattern recognition work with these CNN's? when a car has for example the american flag printed on it would I be able to detect that pattern?,2017-03-06T10:51:30.413,5837
3372,2912,"0",You may have to increase the training set/test set ratio (if I have guessed correctly what you are trying to do - train the network on existing patterns and expect some new patterns to be learned). I have no idea if a classical MLP is able to do this, but a CNN should (though CNN is a general term), because you basically have image pattern recognition task. I do not think there is such thing as problem too simple to be solved.,2017-03-06T13:12:13.973,5858
3373,2928,"0",Interesting question! Please note, though, that questions about the implementation of machine learning are best served at [stats.se] or, in some cases, [datascience.se]. This site is for the social, conceptual, and scientific aspects of AI. For more information on our scope, see the [help/on-topic] and/or [meta]. (I'm glad you got an answer here already.),2017-03-06T15:55:06.070,75
3375,2922,"0",I worked for a major IT company that at one time marketed AI products. The problem with a neural network approach is that there isn't a knowledge base per sey. So without any sort of rules, it is impossible for a neural network to explain "why." Training a neural network, then formulating rules that duplicate the network would give you such answers. But there isn't any form of machine learning that is now capable of such behavior.,2017-03-06T17:59:03.217,3471
3376,2919,"0",Great question!  (I'm also interested in whether quantum computing has the restriction regarding c.),2017-03-06T23:35:48.933,1671
3377,2922,"0",Yeah. In our company the chitchat bot supported only by NN is very very stupid.,2017-03-06T23:49:36.193,5351
3378,2933,"0",Thanks for your reply, was helpful. But I still didn't know about the hardware usage part, can you elaborate on that more?,2017-03-07T01:42:01.010,5873
3379,2934,"0",Thanks a lot, that was really helpful. But, wouldn't it be better for embedded applications such as autonomous cars to have training phase too? It's never too safe for a car to stop learning, I guess.,2017-03-07T02:30:29.543,5873
3380,2934,"0",@MahmoudAbdel-Mon'em it actually would not be that safe for a car to keep learning while in production because it may pick up a bad learning pattern for example: if I drive recklessly I will be able to get to the destination faster and these patterns are not monitored. It would be better if the manufacturer periodically published.  a better model.,2017-03-07T04:13:46.720,4631
3382,2934,"0",I take it that your answer is strictly applicable to the example of autonomous cars. What if we want something more generic? Let's assume an X application that uses DL, would some applications use both hardware systems on them? Or still they'll be using inference system with data pulled from a trained system away?,2017-03-07T12:55:18.373,5873
3383,2934,"0",@MahmoudAbdel-Mon'em except for very very specialized applications you will not have inference and training done on the same system.,2017-03-07T14:49:53.717,4631
3384,2934,"0",thank you. Can you please give me an example of some of the specialized applications that have both systems?,2017-03-07T16:14:43.527,5873
3385,2935,"0",Thank you, Aiden! This sounds like a good starting point to try to solve this problem.,2017-03-07T16:39:36.750,5860
3390,2901,"0",@AmitMaurya That's the whole story. We may reach a point where we cannot wrap our head around what is happening, either because of complexity, or mere too-high pace of change. It seems you have follow-up questions, and those would be terrific new entries on the site.,2017-03-07T21:52:32.457,169
3391,111,"1",I can't answer, so I will only leave this comment... these moral dilemmas, like many moral dilemmas aren't really appropriate to the situation, imo. A machine will never have to face a question like 'somebody has to die, who should i pick'? Also you are underestimating the capability of peripheral sensors. A robotic vehicle's experience of the world is nothing like yours or mine.,2017-03-08T07:04:26.230,5915

3393,2946,"0",thanks a lot. So when we compare a specific DL algorithm to a non-DL algorithm, can we say it's better because it's more accurate? Or because it made solving the problem possible?
Also if we compare 2 DL algorithms, what parameters do we prioritize? Accuracy or speed? Or perhaps other factors, say like memory or power efficiency? Or perhaps even a mix of different parameters for the specific application?,2017-03-08T12:50:55.060,5873
3396,2903,"0",@TariqAli - I watched a video where they were talking with the developers of the XBOX Kinect. All the developers did was create the neural net software for it. From there, the neural net figured out what to do based on the training data. The developers said they would never have been able to get it to work by programming it themselves. So I'd contend that this is an example of an AI that figured out how to build something that humans probably couldn't have done, at least in a reasonable time-frame.,2017-03-08T20:01:01.437,1881

3408,2959,"1",It's funny how irrationality plays such a role.  (Certainly human irrationality is useful to a certain segment, as it allows a great deal of wealth transfer away from parties unrestrained by rationality.)  Based on the media culture in the last US election, I don't see the power of hype diminishing until human decision-making is handed over to more rational systems.,2017-03-10T14:39:09.083,1671

3419,2964,"0",Scientifically,i would say yes according to my perspective in this field, by judging the flow of your concept or idea/problem solution  and i see there is some kind of intelligence in it, so you're trying to build up an intelligent agent,hopefully.however someone might say no simply because you're just saying code analyser & writer that can comprehend algorithm and reproduce it.which can be done in java . as just a basic application by stackoverflow user! but professionally,here i would like to get a glimplse on what tools you're using!...here everyone is looking at your questions.,2017-03-11T10:21:04.220,1581

3421,2960,"1",I think you misunderstand that I'm using a grammatical technicality. My answer is that the word inevitable is too strong to be used here. My argument is that if something can possibly be avoided then it's not inevitable. I understand that my answer isn't particularly interesting or useful, and I don't expect to be credited as the right answer, but it isn't an opinion. It could be wrong, but the definition of inevitable is not my opinion and the definition of a possibility is not my opinion. I'm sorry if it's an over simplified answer, but it isn't an opinion.,2017-03-11T14:36:52.670,3989
3422,2960,"0",Rather than dismissing my answer as an opinion because I'm not presenting research on hype cycles, challenge my answer logically. Explain why my argument doesn't apply here. Show that it's not possible to avoid AI Winter events, and my answer will be wrong. If I am wrong, I'd love to be corrected in the pursuit of knowledge.,2017-03-11T14:39:58.003,3989
3423,2960,"1",While I did accept this answer, I do quibble about your mention of "fear of the unknown". AI Winters are caused not by people fearing AI, but people being disappointed by AI. It's like people wanting to build Skynet because they think it's awesome, actually building it, realizing that Skynet actually wasn't as awesome as they dreamed it to be, and then moth-balling the project. They aren't afraid of Skynet -- in fact, they'd probably mock its inefficiencies.,2017-03-11T21:56:33.397,181

3474,3006,"0",While I really do love this question, I think the answers to this question may be too opinionated and is based heavily on speculation (specifically, predicting what humans would do when faced with their obsolesce). It is also contingent on your predicted future actually occurring (which might be disputed). I voted to close this question, but I definitely think a more narrow version of this question might work (such as, maybe, asking for peer-reviewed articles that discuss what roles humans might play in a AI-dominated world).,2017-03-17T02:22:48.753,181
3476,3006,"0",If I create an artificial intelligence algorithm and I implement it ie.Intelligent software system, and I also give that intelligence the desires and intentions that suit my needs, so the idea that an intelligent system would want to have freedom in the way a human does, I think is a misconception.People nowadays have been terribly misinformed what A.I is,what is capable of?

There's no question that doing original research requires linear algebra, multi-variable calculus, etc.  And there's no doubt that the more you understand the math and the theory.  But at the same time, it seems clear to me that there's a distinction between "applied machine learning" and "ML research" and that you can do a lot of the former, and create a lot of value, without knowing a lot of math.,2017-03-17T20:10:59.757,33

3602,3080,"1",Hello james.professionally,I would suggest python and C/C++ for instance;Python has several powerful libraries or packages,that will help with machine learning such as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).
look at C/C++; many machine learning algorithms are processor constrained so AI software engineers try to get as close to the metal as they can. C++ has a speed advantage over Java much (but not all) of the time. Java is often better for big collaborative projects.Also go through this post http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/3019/can-lua-be-a-stable-portable-and-powerful-language-for-ai,2017-04-01T14:14:59.807,1581

3604,3073,"0",@quintumnia They're currently in the very early stage of development, but the scope of the first stage automata is described here: [Epimetheus](http://www.fundamentalcombinatronics.com/epimetheus/). The game complexity will ultimately range from < Chess to > Go, where the immediate, practical need is for local, constrained, weak, general AI. (The model is a fundamental economic "metagame", based on a small set of combinatorial mechanics with an alarming range of extensions, i.e. the product.)  Right now I'm just trying to get a gauge on similar initiatives, since I'm still new to the field.,2017-04-01T18:56:48.420,1671
3605,3080,"0",We're just finishing up a development cycle for mobile applications utilizing Java and Objective C.

The object is essentially a column of grouped together dots that shows up relative to background dots surrounding the object.  If there are many background dots, then a zoomed in window might confuse background information for a column of clustered dots.  In other words, it's the sudden increase in dot number, synchronized in a vertical fashion, that I am attempting to recognize.,2017-04-06T18:01:53.757,6321
3655,3115,"1",There's so many different factors involved in the "AI in a box experiment" that I think it is not really possible to sensibly answer such a question. Basically we have to answer (a) can we build an AGI that is scary enough to *want* to put into a box?, (b) can we build the box in such a manner that the AGI would rather prefer to convince a human being than simply brute-force its way out of the box? and (c) is breaking out of the box something an AGI actually want?

3657,3115,"0",@TylerN. that's a pretty bold assertion that you would even be able to try it yourself in the present tense, since we're still unquantifiabley distant from strong AGI.  My personal feeling is that if the AI understands Nash, it will cooperate, but if it is a hyper-partisan AI (such as in military or financialist applications,) it will seek only to dominate and eliminate all competition.

3721,3158,"1",1. It seems to be more stable in general.
2. When you have a large pretrained network and you want to keep the architecture unchanged and you want to use it to work with a smaller amount of data - I've empirically found that with little data you can apply strong L2 regularization with v. good effects (to fc layers - not to conv layers). The same doesn't apply to dropout. Keeping less than 0.5 neurons may result in v. unstable training.,2017-04-15T12:37:33.907,6648

This subject may require hyperbole at the present state of AGI, but I think it's important to start attempting to tie moral philosophy to Algorithmic Intelligence, particularly in a game theoretic (economic) context, which has many applications in computing, and may be said to form the basis for Algorithmic Intelligence in terms of optimal decision making in the context of bounded rationality.

My personal feeling is that Musk's industrial endeavors are not primarily motivated by personal profit, but out of a deep concern for the future of our species, and uses his celebrity as a platform to raise awareness of issues.,2017-04-21T16:25:53.397,1671

3804,3195,"0",@colourincorrect Quite the opposite. The framework has been rigorously defined and continues to be validated on problems of increasing intractability. Perfect play is not objectively perfect, just more optimal than the opponent's play. But superrationality is still new and requires more research and validation from a mathematical (as opposed to metaphysical) perspective.  Superrationality is being studied in the context of games of imperfect information, such as Prisoner's Dilemma, and if validated, that validation will be mathematical.  Right now it is an hypothesis.,2017-04-21T17:45:46.140,1671

3807,3195,"0",@colourincorrect Game Theory is that framework. There are absolutely strategies for dealing with different levels of indeterminacy, such as P < .5  In simultaneous games, P can never objectively be > .5 , because of hidden information (i.e. the most basic form is a binary [Schroedinger box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat)) Thus no rational agent plays the lottery to win, unless the odds are flawed in a favorable way, which does rarely occur and has been, famously, exploited by mathematicians.,2017-04-21T17:54:25.570,1671
3808,3195,"0",@colourincorrect It is actually a good idea to look at Blackjack, and more recently, Poker for an understanding of how strategy changes if probability can be raised above .5.  Even 50.000000000000000000001% probability will lead to gain given a sufficient number of hands.  The trick is to determine if probability of a given event is truly above this threshold, which also involves confidence levels (analysis of the dataset to reduce margin of error for a sufficient confidence level, such as with a point estimate.)  Recent winning strategies for poker are a function of mathematics.,2017-04-21T17:58:56.710,1671

3950,3298,"0",I dunno neural networks very well. For what you are trying to achieve, I guess you need to first freeze the state and do the execution.

3952,2984,"0",1. when you are talking of RL, the policy (or solution, roughly) the agent finds should ideally account for such uncertainty. 
2. you may want to use some form of approximators or discretizer (if your plan space is discrete, but observations are continuous) to determine the position. You can look at [tile coding][1], for example. Copying from the source, in one line:  Tile coding is a way of representing the values of a vector of continuous variables as a large binary vector with few 1s and many 0s.

Nothing stops you from keeping the sequence of the images you are evaluating in memory and then appending their results to get the entire license plate. Consider what you are doing when reading a license plate. You read each value, therefore the computer must do the same. Unfortunately we are much better segmenters than computers are.,2017-05-15T20:30:18.657,5925

As it is in the example I just showed, those nerves can't fundamentally know whether they're touching a wall (which the network learns to avoid) or a "booster" for example (which we want the network to learn to be attracted to). So from what you were saying, it seemed to me to do this, we need to create a second set of nerves and a second set of input neurons, and have the second set of nerves only detect good.,2017-05-18T06:57:19.743,7249
4026,3329,"0",In your example a single nerve cannot know whether it is touching a booster or a wall, but the full input of all nerves makes it able to derive which nerves are touching a wall and which a booster.,2017-05-18T07:05:03.963,2227

4032,3334,"1",It can only learn the difference if there is a difference in the input to the nerves. If the good circles are green and the bad circles are red and color vision is part of the input, that'll be enough. If the bad circles always move in groups and the good circles are always alone and it input vision is wide enough to see this difference, that would be enough too. This really has nothing to do with having one network or two.,2017-05-18T13:43:04.647,2227
4033,3334,"0",I was never suggesting two networks, I was talking about twice the inputs, one set connected to nerves which collide with good objects, one set which collide with bad. With what you just said "If the good circles are green and the bad circles are red and color vision is part of the input", you surely understand only values between a range of -1 to 1 can be input to each input neuron in a neural network, so how would that "color vision" (the thing Im trying to do basically) work fundamentally? How do you input that to the neural system?,2017-05-18T14:03:33.627,7249

4107,3405,"2",I do not quite understand why initially setting the network weights would defeat the backpropagation purpose? Why is it unfeasible to use quick, greedy heuristics to estimate the value of a certain state, can you elaborate? 
Setting an end reward motivates the agent to reach the end, but it would still need the negative rewards to keep it from using resources it does not need, right? There is no time limit: I do not care if it takes longer to complete a task, as long as it uses as few resources as possible.,2017-05-29T12:30:11.967,7495
4108,3405,"0",You can use some heuristics to start with a network whose weights are not completely random. It is called transfer learning. But it's hard to do because it implies you knowing the values somehow (usually, through previous learning stages). You also cannot just set some specific values and expect others to remain unchanged. As you adjust weights to get some actions to -inf, other action's will get very strange reward values, which will most likely disturb training. Once you start optimizing the network, when you explore, backprop will just optimize the weights and set everything back.,2017-05-29T12:46:29.027,7496
4109,3405,"0",By setting an end reward, you just motivate the agent to finish the task (since he gets the best reward out of finishing it).

4201,3465,"0",@ThomasW Since each peptide sequence has multiple amino acids of the same time, a 3 could represent 3 Ws. For example let's say my peptide sequence is WYTWXTGW, my output vector would have to account for the frequency of each amino acid.,2017-06-09T15:34:29.973,7773

4203,3465,"0",Sorry for the confusion, but the actual sequence is part of the labeled dataset. This is a supervised problem. The input is spectra data that is labeled with a peptide sequence (and thus its corresponding amino acids). The actual data is represented in terms of m/z (a numerical number for spectra data). So if the number is (hypothetically) 4321.32, the peptide sequence could be WYTWXTGW. I want to train a neural network that takes in this information so when it is presented with unlabeled spectra data (after training), it can provide the peptide sequence.,2017-06-09T15:56:32.977,7773

That's my problem  with this :) - i'm not a biological expert, but there are different peptide sequences with the same amount of certain amino acids, right?,2017-06-09T16:04:28.190,5344
4205,3465,"0",Yes you are correct. There is no real way for me to tell the order after the the network is trained by I hope to just output the frequency for now :) . You are also correct that there are different sequences with the same amount of certain amino acids.,2017-06-09T16:06:53.670,7773

4222,3477,"0",Thanks a lot! I'm still ruminating over this answer, which seems to have hit the nail in the head. While I agree that ML is used as a shortcut for complex models (hence, error), I struggle to understand why this would still be the case with simplistic functions.

4223,3478,"0",Thanks a lot! This is a superb answer. I do understand the points given, but this would apply only to complex models being approximated. Simple deterministic problems do not have the approximation model because of the nature of the problem, but rather because of the nature of the model (which implies simplification... but why should it be that way?). akopacsi's answer seems to discuss that aspect, and with both answers I'm closer to getting the point.

4254,3473,"0",The concept of a [solved game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game) may be useful.  If you have 100% accuracy, the problem is tractable, which is rarely the case in highly complex systems.  ML is proving useful in tackling intractable problems, but in a condition of intractability, here a function of [bounded rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality), you never have perfect certainty, only perceived optimality.  The ML system may even get it right 100% of the time in a given sample, but that is no guarantee it will always do so.,2017-06-14T17:19:30.520,1671

They should figure out that the analog waves actually contain digital information, understand the bytecode, filter out the overhead, keep the text information among images, sound etc., and then maybe we can talk about approaches to learn the language.,2017-06-16T09:37:40.420,6899

4272,3505,"0",Ask yourself: do I really need to convert it to bits? Modern implementations just modify the _values_ of the weights. Using bits to do this is highly inefficient. During combining (aka crossover), you could average the weights of the two parents, or select them uniformly. Have a look at [this paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf),2017-06-16T12:09:55.777,5344
4274,3502,"2",The point about AlphaGo is that a certain type of game ([non-trivial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game#Overview), non-chance, perfect information) in particular provides an excellent proving ground for AI because these games have very simple parameters, but complexity akin to nature. Games, from a certain perspective, are the most useful kinds of artifacts because they teach abstract and strategic thinking.  To understand the importance of games, look at the [impact of Game Theory on computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory#Computer_science_and_logic).,2017-06-16T17:00:39.930,1671

4276,3505,"0",From experience, crossover between two parent NN just gives unusable offsprings, it works much better if you skip crossover all together and use mutation as the main offspring generator. Another advice, keep your weights data type as is.,2017-06-17T18:57:43.780,3874

4284,3505,"0",Are you still using backprop?  If so, you need to preserve a differentiable gradient across your network to backpropagate the error, which I believe any swapping of data (weights) in/out will disrupt. If not, it seems to me that training a NN using evolution instead of backprop will be counterproductive.  This is because: 1) in theory, it's bad to replace a continuous learning method like backprop with discontinuous methods like crossover and mutation, and 2) in practice, evolution will prove to be a circuitous and *very* slow way to train a NN's many weights.,2017-06-19T20:14:22.930,1657
4288,3518,"1",What you're describing is a type of what's known as a coevolutionary algorithm. Googling that should be a useful exercise.

I'd also point out that the general idea of playing against versions of yourself has a long history in the literature around learning to play games. One of the very earliest real success stories in AI was Arthur Samuel's checkers program in 1959. He trained a program to play the game at the level of a very strong human by having it play games against itself, each time improving itself via a mechanism that resembles what we would today call reinforcement learning.,2017-06-20T14:18:50.840,3365

I favor this approach because I can use guided learning to give my automata some basic axioms, but let their intelligence be a factor of self evolution, which hopefully leads to axioms they themselves discover. :),2017-06-20T20:40:29.747,1671

4385,3584,"0",To my understanding the standard thought process (per a guy like Jerry Fodor) goes like this: 1. Folk psychology deploys a language that is powerful and productive 2. It seems that this set of language is powerful because of its structure (propositional attitudes over mental representations) 3. There seems to be a natural mapping between that language and the syntax of logic (indeed, is there anything that isn't logic like?) 4. The analogy is productive in fields such as neuroscience and psychology 5. The standard mode of understanding computation is through a Turing Machine,2017-07-06T18:00:08.340,6779

4390,3593,"0",@Ugnes Thanks for clarifying, but my point still holds.  Turing test passing is a nice idea, but it's very philosophical, and entirely subjective.  It's also fairly meaningless because passing a Turing test doesn't mean self-awareness or volition.  Game Theory and Combinatorial Game Theory are  practical, procedural and mathematical, and the restriction of game AI to "narrow" is likely a reflection on the limited nature of current game models.  Metagames like [M] provide a bridge to the two fields, and may provide a compact model for fundamental AGI.,2017-07-06T18:59:43.877,1671
4391,3593,"0",@Ugnes If McCarthy restricts his comments to Chess specifically, it demonstrates a disconnect regarding the wider scope of combinatorial games, and different types of advances and applications that may arise from the analysis of these games.

4393,3593,"1",@Ugnes I guess partly what I'm saying is that, approaching AGI at a high level will probably just be "smoke and mirrors".  My hypothesis is that AGI needs to be approached at a fundamental level, with basic volitional (economic) functions that become "autonomic".  Once you have that, you can build on top of it by plugging Natural Language Processing, etc.  I'm skeptical of any approach to AGI that is not rooted in Game Theory and it's extensions, which apply to all decision-making, whether conscious or autonomic (as in the case of simple organisms.),2017-07-06T19:12:37.647,1671

4398,3590,"2",My short answer is that games like Chess and Go have complexity akin to nature (by which I mean the universe) and are useful to study, particularly in their unsolved states, b/c, like looking out into the universe, you never know what you're going to find.  Simple combinatorial models, of which games are the most useful for AI, can be infinitely expansive.  Pure mathematics often takes a while to find applications, but it has a very good track record in this respect.  Even where such games are solved, solutions can still be refined.,2017-07-06T21:40:00.087,1671

4428,2390,"0",Cognition must be probabilistic to be useful for anything more complex than simple games with discrete permissions rules for moves. Even to answer a question about a person's hair color is a judgment call. Cognitive functions may procure binary results, but only after continuous incoming signals are sampled and weighed.

My understanding is self replicating organisms require very hard and very precise engineering, and these are the initial conditions, not random initial conditions.  Even greatly more so if the self replication organism is Turing complete.  Also, why does randomness produce consciousness?

The consciousness article is interesting, but no function is truly recursive in implementation.  It becomes a call stack which is essentially a number of functions.

Of course, if your featurespace is too high dimensional for the limited amount of data you have. Then you will have problems.

4462,3624,"0",@yters part of the reason I attempted an answer is b/c I think Conway's idea should be included.  On one hand, you have philosophers saying "it can't be done, there's too much we don't understand, and it involves problems outside of material existence."  On the other hand, you have a mathematician who works on things like sphere packing in n-dimensions, and has only lately gotten into philosophy (free will theorem), who holds the opinion that while it's still theoretical and extraordinarily complex, there's nothing in the mathematics that would render this infeasible.,2017-07-12T18:52:58.603,1671
4463,3624,"0",Yes, that's an answer to my question, that human intelligence is reproducible by a Turing machine, and Turing complete automata can be generated randomly in Life.

As @mindcrime notes, the formal definitions are sort of fuzzy and continually evolving, but decision-making seems to be at the root of algorithmic (artificial) intelligence from the standpoint of both purpose and function.,2017-07-27T16:45:35.200,1671
5685,3722,"0",I can say with absolute certainty that "any technology that allows a computer to do something well that currently only humans can do well" is merely a qualifier for AI strength, and is in no way a fundamental description of AI in general. *(This is why mindcrime was careful to present it as a "popular definition", and make the point about non-universality of opinions regarding brute force approaches--when Euler started analyzing Latin Squares, he used brute force and I don't think anyone would say Euler wasn't intelligent!;)*,2017-07-27T17:33:26.237,1671

5732,2525,"0",This is a great answer, although I'm not convinced ethics are rooted in narrative so much as narrative is used as allegory for underlying mathematical truths.  As usual, I'm thinking about the ancient philosophical history of balance (equilibrium) and harmony as "good"--both concepts are rooted in mathematics.  The [superrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality) strategy, for instance, is a mathematical validation of the Golden Rule: "do unto others as you would have then do unto you".,2017-08-02T16:13:24.700,1671
5735,3749,"0",Unfortunately, it's more of a chat question, but I'm worried it would be overlooked and you wouldn't get any info.

5736,2582,"0",Nice overview.  I think Asimov is important for highlighting the potential flaws of logic with the "3 rules of robotics".  Scifi in this vein I do believe is useful for introducing important concepts.  Phil Dick, for instance, can be understood as a narrative philosopher, and he made evolutionary game theory the central plot point of Electric Sheep several years before the field was formalized. Recently, Hannu Rajaneimi delivered a very good series on this subject with the Quantum Thief trilogy, which starts off in a "dilemma prison".  Artist are often significantly ahead of academics.,2017-08-02T16:57:39.360,1671

5746,2525,"1",That is an interesting perspective and is very much the realm of philosophy. This question, however, is how AI researchers are likely to think so the answer is based on continuing trends in AI research. It would be interesting to explore super-rationality within the field of artificial intelligence but I do not think it has been studied or at least is not popular enough of a topic to change how most AI researchers would consider these questions.,2017-08-03T01:03:31.173,4398
5747,2525,"0",That's precisely why I mentioned it.  From my perspective, Game Theory underlies all AI, because AI is the about making the most optimal decisions. 
 If researchers are not thinking of the ethical implications from this perspective, I suspect they're treading on very dangerous ground.  (I use Game Theory here in the *broadest* possible sense, which includes all extensions and even can be regarded as subsuming Decision Theory.)  My gauge of the realities of the field of AI are that it's all about economic drivers, which is highly problematic.,2017-08-03T01:21:18.283,1671
5748,3752,"1",Got pinged from Biology.SE. This answer is good, certainly good enough for this field. Layers in real neocortex differ from most neural networks in that they are massively recurrent, consist of simultaneously active feed-forward and feed-back, and very dependent on recent history and overall state. And that's just in one visual area (like V1). Some artificial networks impart some of these features, others mimic them with other more computationally-friendly mechanisms.,2017-08-03T01:56:21.220,8833
5749,2525,"0",PS- please don't misinterpret intent as to diminish your excellent answer. Quite the opposite!  It's *because* the answer has such merit that I wanted to take the time to comment on a related subject that is a preoccupation of mine.,2017-08-03T01:58:00.420,1671
5750,3739,"0",@JadenTravnik's answer is good, also see my comment there. The difference between the reference here and that answer is this citation seems to be implying that there is a feed-forward structure in a *single column* in neocortex (since that's the picture represented here). This is certainly false, though works as a model sometimes. Although there is evidence for some feed-forward processing in a column, there is also a ton of recurrence and feedback. The feed-forward structure makes more sense between cortical areas (this is what the answer below addresses).,2017-08-03T01:58:51.927,8833
5751,3739,"0",The terminology of "layer" has a different meaning in the two contexts as well. When biologists talk about cortical "layers" they mean anatomical layers, not functional neural network-style layers. Cells within one layer are highly interconnected with each other, as well as to a lesser extent with cells of all of the other layers. Some of the connectivity is in this answer to a different question at biology.se: https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/57495/cortical-projections-from-layers-2-3-back-to-4/57519#57519,2017-08-03T02:00:27.730,8833

If you have a continuous time series with interval-based labels, the discrete tokens could be calculated from intervals, say by chunking the time series into bins and mapping to tokens based on some function whose input is the time series in that bin.  Consider human speech, where the audio can be mapped to phonemes and modeled with an HMM.,2017-08-05T18:04:08.393,8599

5792,3775,"2",Great question and welcome to AI!  Per your 3rd idea, although human assisted machine learning isn't the hot field right now, my understanding is that it's a quite valuable and productive approach. I like this question very much, as it touches on linguistics (semantics), and I will definitely be thinking on it and try to generate some meaningful terms.,2017-08-08T00:15:18.893,1671
5793,3776,"1",Thanks. Your answer is valid since I didn't define the type of AI in my question. I didn't actually mean general AI, since it wouldn't necessarily need any help from humans as you said. I'm more after solutions that apply for an AI that is greater or equal to weak AI but less than general AI.,2017-08-08T07:47:50.637,8918

5796,3779,"0",If you want reduce memory usage by the network then reducing the number of possible inputs (by rotating) will help to have a smaller network. The easier the learning task is the smaller network needed. In this case pre-processing would be better. Nevertheless NN is for concept learning and to learn the concept of Game of Life you should feed in all patterns. If your aim is to absolutely minimize memory footprint solve the problem on a linear way.,2017-08-08T12:27:35.533,7364
5797,3779,"0",If memory is not a concern, I would rather the network performs this operation for the same reasons you stated. Pre-processing removes some of the task from the network, simplifying it.,2017-08-08T12:31:43.780,8872
5798,3779,"0",Correct, then go for the pre-processing. I think with this the question is answered. You may chose to implement it if you run into issues with memory. Tip: use float for the weights that takes only 32 bits instead of double that takes 64. This will use less memory.,2017-08-08T12:56:53.243,7364

5803,3782,"1",Thanks. Can you elaborate the second idea? Do you mean that the employees who were sacked due to AI would start working for the government, where they search for companies similar to their previous employer, which would lead the government collecting higher taxes from these companies? All your ideas are good, but I'm afraid those new job descriptions could be too different from the old ones (depending on the old occupation). The way I see it, the optimal new job descriptions would be the kind where an employee can continue working in his field and somehow use his domain-specific knowledge.,2017-08-09T06:50:29.647,8918

The one foundational principle of science, which have never, ever been challenged is that science is a closed world - meaning that to explain natural science, one MUST explain it in terms of other natural concepts, one cannot make any appeals to super-natural concepts. Physicalism and science are closed worlds that do not leave room to adequately explain how consciousness gets created by purely physical parts.

A mathematical approach to philosophy would go a long way toward ensuring precision in the context of human/AI value alignment. i.e. I regard Nash as a philosopher in addition to an important mathematician.)*,2017-08-15T19:57:14.560,1671

5892,3836,"1",@quintumnia I found the possible duplicate: https://ai.stackexchange.com/q/3814/1671   Still wondering if this question is distinct in that it asks specifically whether "strong narrow" AI controlling multiple game agents would be harder to create than an AI of similar strength controlling a single game agent.  My feeling is that Game Theory and Complexity Theory strongly indicate that the multi-agent controller will be more difficult.  (Although this could be modified if the mechanics for dota2 are significantly less complex than Starcraft.),2017-08-18T15:38:23.583,1671
5893,3835,"0",Nice analysis.  Related: https://ai.stackexchange.com/a/3838/1671  *(I attempted an answer to a similar question without knowing too much about the dota2 mechanics, and took the line that "assuming both games have similar complexity in terms of mechanics...")*,2017-08-18T15:51:02.303,1671
5894,3833,"1",I do think the drive at DeepMind is to morph "strong narrow AI" into Artificial General Intelligence, and games are definitely a way to approach this. In some sense AGI, without reference to "strength" can be regarded as consistent strength across a wide and ever expanding array of contexts.  These context could be as simple as combinatorial games with slight difference in game mechanics, or wildly different games, such as dota2 and Starcraft.  I'm upvoting because this answer is reductionist in a valuable way, getting to the core of the matter.,2017-08-18T15:54:25.627,1671

5909,3837,"0",yes, the environment and the actions are set up. (the simulation works with multiple agents but they are not cooperate at the moment) 
The question is how should agent1 alter agent2's plan, that agent2 has TalkToAgent2 as current Action (if and only if Agent2 like to talk). and after that how agent1 knows that agen2 want to talk with agent1 (has TalkToAgen1 as current Action).

5924,3837,"1",You shouldn't expect to be able to program explicit some sequences of actions to achieve some goal state. The point of this method of AI programming is such that it "discovers" its own actions based on how the agent is embedded in the environment. If you really want to design a specific sequence of actions, you should fine-tune the environment around it to conduce such behavior. 

Recall from the paper that cooperative action (flanking) is emergent behavior, not explicitly programmed into the game.

tl;dr i think the method of implementation needs to change, but not sure in what way,2017-08-20T21:07:18.437,6779
5925,3836,"1",@quintumnia Similar but not duplicate imo.

5928,3838,"0",While it is true that the coordination of several agents is more complex, I don't think this holds true for the question at hand. In Dota2 you have different accounts playing the game, which must be considered building the architecture of the AI. But In Starcraft you have way more individual units playing together on the same map. I don't see why an AI should treat the individual heroes in dota2 differently than the individual units in Starcraft from a strategic standpoint.,2017-08-21T09:41:59.567,9161

In Starcraft, there are many decisions, but only one decision-maker (game agent).  In dota2, there are 4 decision-makers.  So the Starcraft AI only has to make one decision at a time, while the dota2 AI has to make 4 decisions at a time.,2017-08-21T16:50:47.347,1671

5955,3842,"0",Personally I think yes undoubtedly there are constants, from my sentience  and "perception of the world" undoubtedly there is a constant the only thing that occurs through time is the redistribution of the parts of the constant within the bounds of it. Maybe the complexity of its distribution is what sentience, intelligence has arison from and maybe a replication of similar complexity through smaller parts will enable us to create a similar intelligence that we appear to have. I don't think sentience has a range of meanings u wouldn't consider a brick to have it. It's purely in life.,2017-08-22T18:43:18.087,9094

As absurd as it may sound to many, my project involves making "dumb" in addition to "smart" AI because humans playing the game have different levels of skill, and losing every game is no kind of fun for the vast majority of players.

I know for some programmable AIs the engine allows a submission of several actions per 'game step' so you could in practice have many unit's actions per step which would give a significant advantage to machines and programs that can get more actions per step. If however you limit the APM's that the AI can submit then there's another optimization problem available with which actions are the best to submit per game step. Also to note, in SC2 you can submit one game action and influence many units.,2017-08-24T02:04:01.577,9110

6029,3901,"1",I did the changes as suggested and indeed the learning process tends to 1. However i have a few questions.
  
1) why do the weights tend to -1 and -1? if i input 1 1, the output is -1*1 + -1*1 +2 =0. But the answer should be 1 according to AND truth table. It seems that the output is still not correct?

2) could someone explain or provide a link to the importance of learning rate here? i realize that the weights tend more to -1 if i use a small rate like 0.00015. and it gets less accurate when i use a higher learning rate. How do i determine the correct learning rate to use?

6037,3901,"0",It tends towards 0 because 0 (or above) is the threshold for the perceptron to fire. Firing means "output 1" and not firing means "output 0". Using 0 is kind of arbitrary here, but that's what's usually used for perceptrons so I followed this convention. The learning rate just tells you how fast you are learning in each steps. A slower learning rate will require more training cycles but might get you closer to the "perfect" values in the end. There are mechanisms to determine a good constant or even dynamic learning rate, but in the beginning it is mostly trial and error. Hope that helps!,2017-08-28T21:43:19.083,9161

Real neurons process the history of firing in conjunction with more global and regional chemical signaling in ways that are only partially understood. Only a small portion of the habituation, sensitization, and classical conditioning behavior of neurons has been primitively simulated.

6138,268,"1",@ZakkDiaz, AI researchers were interested in both performance and profit before most of those writing machine learning code today graduated kindergarten. I grant you that, since ARPANET went public, the volume of unreliable and poorly organized data has grown to astronomical proportions and requires supercomputing to analyze, requiring larger investments and therefore multinational funding sources. To a large degree though, the trends in R&D and the associated terminology are largely independent from one another, the later being mostly branding, and both trends are somewhat arbitrary.,2017-09-03T01:46:11.297,9203

6151,3957,"0",@DouglasDaseeco Our advantage over apes in your example is the fact, that the human evolved naturally while a superintelligent AI will (most likely) be designed. Once it has been created, thinking about measures of control is far too late. The only chance is establishing control mechanisms before the AI can intervene. If such mechanisms can be strong enough is still an open debate. We should nevertheless think very hard about this problem and study it in detail, because (at least in my opinion) it is highly unlikely that we won't be able or willing to create a superintelligence in the future.,2017-09-04T07:07:35.880,9161
6152,3957,"0",To clarify my evolved vs. designed argument - the designer has the chance to set restrictions and measures before the new creation is built and can counteract.

Improvement during replication is another option, as in the popular explanation for the emergence of human intelligence.

You mention that you want to use the vector representation achieved after each learning iteration to modify the input **data set** for the next iteration!

6173,3954,"0",Also about the varying sizes of images as **Input Data Set**, can be handled easily in preprocessing.
You can easily compress the  images to suitable size, because we don't really require high scale images for character classification; as not much detail is required in an image to represent a character.
Go for gray scale images for about 400 pixel size and your network will work miracles!, even though you wan to test on a real world image that would be of much higher resolution; you can just take the image through the preprocessing task and then classify.,2017-09-05T08:24:21.040,9374

6193,3982,"1",No, fitness is just time. The problem is that that way it favours the units that only use thrust (the spawn point is in the center of the cube), the result is that it never learns to react for input from other sensors because any species that would go out of center would need to learn to react to side sensors and counter steer but those species extinct because they crash early (much quicker than ones that hover in the middle of the box using just thrust).,2017-09-06T20:37:23.853,9450

6195,3931,"0",@k.c.sayz, In this researcher's opinion, the prudent prerequisite for a feasibility study of brain capability simulation would be a feasibility study of the simulation of smaller anatomical units.

6204,3991,"1",I suspect that a stronger image recognition+NLP AI will eventually be able determine with high confidence that "keep" is synonymous with relevant concepts such as "grasp".  Similarly, the AI should be able to determine that "hands" may be taken to indicate the single hand depicted (typo or determination that only one hand is visible, and therefore relevant.) But even with these simple examples, a growing subset of humans will become confused: i.e. what is the verb tense of "keep"?  Should the phrase be taken to mean that only one of the hands will ultimately possess the rose?,2017-09-08T17:37:52.030,1671

6312,4040,"0",AI problems can be posed as search problems. It's all about decision making. What should I do next? Now, if Aiwyn's a finite player (i.e. it's playing a finite game) then that would mean that it has a finite objective (e.g. to destroy the One Ring by throwing it in the Cracks of Doom). To achieve this goal it might need to pass off as human (or hobbit, orc, whatever). That means that it would need to pass the Turing Test. However, does that make it conscious? No. Passing off as being conscious doesn't imply actually being conscious.,2017-09-17T19:56:57.057,9634
6313,4040,"0",I conjecture that it's impossible for Aiwyn to be conscious if it's only playing a finite game because then it would have nothing to look forward to after the game is over. It wouldn't be "conscious" in the sense that you and I are conscious. For example, suppose your goal in life is to raise kids until they can take care of themselves. Once you've achieved your goal, will you just stop living? Will you have nothing else to do? No. Your mind will make new desires and set new goals because your mind is playing an infinite game.,2017-09-17T19:57:13.420,9634

6331,3931,"0",I agree with FauChristian: Gypped!. If what this community calls bounties are spent to buy attention, then we have a misnomer. The attention system should call the advertisement an ad, because that is what you, @ben-n, have described. I don't need the help center. The help center needs a dictionary. A bounty is a price paid for a third party to bring tangible results.

However, AI people should know the difference.,2017-09-19T01:23:37.813,4302
6332,4055,"0",I might look at stinginess as the direct application of minimax in non-iterated  dilemma.  The agent takes the pessimistic strategy, which does not maximize benefit, because the rational approach is to minimize harm in a worst-case scenario.  This in itself is not evil, because there is no communication between the competing agents.  This is distinct from iterated dilemma, where an agent can communicate it's superrationality by cooperating on the first iteration (golden rule) and second iteration, even with a previous betrayal by the competing agent (turn the other cheek).,2017-09-19T02:07:26.630,1671
6333,4055,"0",In iterated Dilemma, if the competing agent persists in betrayal despite the cooperative action of the superrational agent, which constitutes communication of the agent's superrationality, the betrayal becomes non-rational.  (i.e. the rational agent is now ahead, and can risk cooperation without the risk of being worse off in aggregate than the competitor.)  At this point the betraying agent is hampering the maximization of benefit.  Thus, from an economic standpoint, a strategy of persistent betrayal regardless of circumstance may be regarded as evil.  The evil agent never cooperates.,2017-09-19T02:07:33.280,1671

I realize that the exact 3 laws from the stories can't work, but surely there is a set of more robust ones that can limit an AI to good behavior in the same way that people are restricted by law.,2017-09-19T12:43:24.510,9648

6344,4071,"0",Hello, thanks for the answer! I will investigate these areas to see what applies. I have added a short description of the game in the hopes this narrows it down for you. My engine supports undos so that may be useful in conjunction with NN. As the engine is unfinished, I do not have a sample set but plan on keeping all game histories from the hosting server between 2 players.

6372,4055,"1",@JawadAlShaikh I'll review your question changes and amend when I get some time.  Hyperpartisanism creates a condition where each side of the fence may regard those on the other side as evil.  So when you look at hyperpartisan AI, harnessed by individual states or corporations with an objective of total ownership/control, regardless of the human toll, you're looking at potentially highly destructive (evil) behaviors.  You might want to review John Forbes Nash's work in game theory.  (Cooperation vs. Competition.)  Buckminster Fuller held similar views, but Nash' work was a mathematical proof.,2017-09-21T21:21:06.847,1671

6379,4072,"0",@Jeremy Your question is definitely important, and the community here wishes to help you. There is a problem: Your question is way to broad to give meaningful answers. Theory and programming are both whole worlds on their own. Also, Q&A sites like this one aim at building up knowledge that is stable over time. What you are asking is evolving, fast. So narrower questions are more useful to the community, and I think to you too. Please see what quintumnia links to.

6382,4076,"1",You are looking for an unsupervised learning algorithm, but before I attempt an answer, there are two questions: (1) Must they be exact matches for all fields, or for a match to occur some criteria must be met other than exactness? (2) Must the sequence itself be exact or fuzzy in that adjacent elements could be swapped or an element might be missing in one of the two sequences that fuzzy match one another?,2017-09-22T02:35:12.647,4302

6387,4076,"1",Thanks for your comment. To answer your questions: (1) Yes, exact matches would be ideal, although I am prepared to drop fields if this improves pattern detection. (2) Ideally exact, but some sequences of actions could lead to the same end result, so, as long as I can control for that / specify what actions can be swapped, I am willing to accept fuzzy matching.,2017-09-22T09:36:17.287,9720

6392,4055,"0",@JawadAlShaikh How we can predict what a complex algorithm may be thinking is another matter entirely, but I think game theory explains mathematically the basis for ethics in the sense of altruism.  So there, at least, we have one mathematical/ethical connection.  Game theory is also concerned with analysis of equilibria, which again has a moral component in early philosophers who talked about balance as "the good".  Decision theory underlies AI, and from my perspective, game theory subsumes decision theory in this regard.,2017-09-22T18:58:08.977,1671

6425,4112,"1",I don't actually think the quote was negative or off-topic, just that anything involving politics is going to be potentially divisive, particularly in the current climate. *(The question of Russian influence in the recent US election is a hot-button topic at present, and the US GSA recently de-listed Kaspersky as allowed software.)*  But as Russia is home to many of the world's finest mathematicians and engineers, I personally think this is a relevant subject.

And finally your training data looks different from your test data. Normally you would take a data set and split it randomly in training and test data. Your sets are obviously not created using random samples. There might be a fundamental misunderstanding what those sets are used for.,2017-09-29T12:10:45.133,9161

6494,4159,"1",@Jawad Al Shaikh the evil in video games characters is quantification and is associated added or taken away from the characters by the action in the games but that quantification is judged and given by the programmers that have allready accounted for the subsequent and possible actions. Evil in the real world is beyond quantification and is judged to whom it occurs and is witnessed by. It's a deep question that if material digital computers in there programing can create an awareness that would have replicated emotions that then would be able to judge the evil there consience judged.,2017-10-03T18:12:26.247,9094

6510,4159,"1",I agree if theres no absolute how can you ever get a measure of some other evil if there no absolute to measure it's degree of evil from. Another one is our perception of order and disorder people judge elements of the physical world to be more or less order than another element but there is no absolute measure of entropy so how can you likewise get a measure similarly.,2017-10-04T21:57:08.730,9094
6511,4159,"0",If there is absolute evil, it would take control over the universe ages ago! isn't? about evil measurement: its relative to person believes, knowledge and experience. Based on my information most of human scientific advancement based on relative measurements (ex: think of reference point). Anything affected by changes can't be absolute, so I don't see that as a concern. Hope this make sense to you otherwise I'll be waiting for more comments :),2017-10-04T22:41:01.243,9685
6512,4159,"1",Yeah I understand that measurement  is relative and uses a scale that we arbitrarily choose. And using this scale we can measure a quantity of something as product of that scale we a referencing. And change is measured using these scales giving variable quantities of what you are measuring over time. But the quantity you get returned is a function of that scale. The reduction returned by that scale will only ever result in knowledge based upon it. Since there is no limit to scale doesn't it mean that knowledge gained by it is limited, another scale would reveal something else. Ad infinitum.,2017-10-04T23:14:48.020,9094

6523,4192,"1",@SteepSlope if it's a deterministic algorithm, the intelligent system would produce the same result for the same data, but purely deterministic algorithms are rare for stronger AI these days.  My comment would be that intelligence alone does not connote human-level intelligence, superintelligence, or even strong AI, just basic decision-making or analytic capability *(but I'm sort of a fundamentalist in this regard b/c my own endeavors partly involve the utility of AIs that are not-so-smart.)*,2017-10-05T20:16:44.000,1671

randomness ... It may well be
true that classically stochastic processes such as
tossing a (true) coin do not help in explaining free
will, but, as we show, adding randomness also does not explain
the quantum mechanical effects ... It is precisely the “semi-free” nature of
twinned particles, and more generally of entanglement,
that shows that something very different
from classical stochasticism is at play here."*,2017-10-05T20:25:51.407,1671

Causality and choice is a head state mate because you percieve causality from day to day well at least we percieve that.

6570,4195,"0",@Bobs nice insight, regarding Consciousness: we are creatures, when we acquire knowledge (let's say X piece of information) it ends up triggering an action based on certain threshold! we can model behaviors into systems and in similar manner an action will result based on biasing a threshold, that's an abstraction that sort of mimic consciousness. Ex: in video games when you change difficulty from easy to hard, characters behavior change. The way the behavioral model intercept/process an input determine the outcome even in human. Make sense?,2017-10-09T18:10:14.567,9685
6572,4195,"0",@Jawad Al Shaikh would you say that the behaviour associated in video games when the difficulty changes is resulted by a conscious attempt by the bots to increase the difficulty of your progress. My take on dreams is pretty crazy it reduces down to the lucid and the not, The not you remember solely the lucid you remember having a choice over it and are able to 'determine' the progress. I have had lucid dreams and the information within them I have no definite idea as to its origin but I know it's not from the physical world as you are sensory dislocated from it, in that state.,2017-10-09T19:48:38.580,9094

6586,4209,"0",It seems like you might want to add additional layering for score instead of just the immediate I moved one degree I get a point. Perhaps a moving window that calculates total degrees moved over the last TBD-seconds. I would probably give that more weight than near-term score. I would think that should help prevent weaving and circling. Which might beg the question of why keep a near-term score at all but I would keep the near-term score because I suspect it will help get around obstacles.,2017-10-11T17:21:56.280,1881
6589,4209,"0",You also might need to take into account 'obstacles' movement. That includes speed and direction. Perhaps your cars are circling because they are trying to avoid other cars. However, in a real race, cars race side-by-side because they have to assume the other drivers are going to follow certain 'driving rules'. Thus, they don't need to be concerned about hitting cars driving next to them. Their biggest concern is not hitting the car in front of them.,2017-10-11T17:25:55.887,1881

If you read the question again, you will find that the question is specifically about using DNN and not anything else. the project you shared is about using Opencv ... if you read the comments under the post you shared, you will find that people are asking about DNN, but the post itself does not use DNN.

Most deviations between theoretical models and empirical data are systematic, often chaotic, possessing distributions that are not nearly normal.

6717,4331,"0",Yep, they very well might crossover with themselves, in which case you get offspring equal to the parents. That's fine. It's also fine to prohibit that though. There are common motifs in GAs, but there's no strict guidelines other than "do whatever works" based on experience and experimentation. A simple GA that uses roulette wheel with replacement, simple crossovers like 1-point or 2-point, and bitwise mutation is a very common starting point. Just note there are likely to be many better performing options once you get more of a grounding in the area.,2017-10-23T17:49:22.740,3365

6748,2747,"1",Some suggestions: Also answer the second question about distances lower than 1 too. The two bulletted claims in the middle of the question incorrect and should be challenged.

6749,2753,"0",The least squares or L2 Norm is not often selected because of its derivation from the method of maximum likelihood. The distribution of errors in practice are rarely determined and when they are determined are rarely normal.

6820,4415,"1",Downvotes without explanation (and often without obvious reason) are common here, don't worry about it. It might have been because your question is not a real AI question, but can rather be solved with a simple image processing algorithm. Nevertheless, Computer Vision is considered an important part of AI development right now, so I think it can be argued that the question is still on topic. +1 from my side for the interesting challenge.,2017-11-02T20:15:30.840,9161

6822,4420,"0",intelligent answer I agree consiousness and intelligence could be distinguished you see other creatures react similarly to humans in similar situation that reaction is a response to the physical world and I don't think that is down solely to consiousness problem solving yes can be programmed and algorithms applied via that programming can perform tasks that simulate the behaviour of creatures in a machine. now if you attribute that problem solving as intelligence yes machines are now. But you can also attribute behaviour other than problem solving that only a consience would do.,2017-11-02T22:00:20.933,9094

6824,4420,"0",I also agree that the location of consiousness is a function of the senses and is result of transmission and destination of the information received by those senses but I will add that the transmission of this information requires a medium that will be unable to replicated in machines and also forms a question as to the possible location within them,2017-11-02T22:15:07.960,9094

6827,4400,"0",Actually i compensated the low learning rate by a large number of epochs..with 100000 epochs for learning rate=0.001...also i took the best accuracy among the weights and plotted it..also somehow the accuracy measure is not working because for batch learning the final classifying line is going above both the data sets i.e for both the data sets value is negative  for all training vectors yet the accuracy is still 88%....also i am not strictly using delta rule for batch learning, i am taking the error to be either [1 ,0, -1]..maybe now you understand where the problem lies?,2017-11-04T05:48:52.350,9947

6832,4400,"0",@DuttaA higher learning rate will surely result in amplifying effect. increasing training epochs instead of increasing learning rate was a good idea...  plus, why are you including [0] class? if you are using one decision boundary, then it means your dataset must have had two classes. for a single instance of dataset, being located on the decision boundary doesn't mean "0" label beside 1 and -1. if your dataset has 3 classes, use multiple classification approaches (either OvO or OvA) which means you have more than one decision boundary. maybe the odd results are caused by this interpretation.,2017-11-04T12:45:51.050,6258
6834,4400,"0",my dataset only has 2 classes...actually i am new to this and i am studying from a book which has used 1 and 0 as to whether in class 1 or class 2 and defined error as target-classification result hence the error might be 1, 0 or -1.,2017-11-04T17:46:05.143,9947

Even if it were the existence of qualia within machines would be just as difficult to detect as it is in other humans because of the nature of it.

6852,3943,"0",Well @ginge, I may be wrong trying to use a learning algorithm for this task, but the reason is that it is not about cut optimizing on my side, another software does it for me. What I need to optimise is a score I give to that software in order to give this machine more or less room for optimisation depending on how quickly I need some parts and how much space I have left to store the parts that are cut earlier.,2017-11-06T13:18:01.520,9361

6860,3994,"0",The output could be a single number (binary classification) or a vector (multiple classification) with values from 0 to 1. A threshold comes in place to the first, a threshold is a parameter number [0,1], and you can choice based on the consequences you prefer (see ROC curve), or in the case of the vector you can assign the class of the maximum number. As said Paul, you could pass the output vector for a function, let’s call `assign_max_class(output_vector)`,2017-11-08T00:30:35.180,9574

We need to reformulate the problem and need more detailed data, but then it can be formulated as a mixed integer program and solved using optimization software like GAMS/CPLEX.

6871,4465,"2",One big example I can think of is when you want an agent to learn about its surroundings without actually optimizing anything. This is part of the problem of continual learning, you need to build an internal model like "I hit walls when my distance sensor reads a wall is close" then that agent can generalize that information to multiple tasks if they arose.,2017-11-10T02:31:42.403,4398

6883,4485,"0",Thank you for your answer, Neil. I tried some various CNN setups and, as expected, none were able to converge on the problem. That was very insightful for me, as my journey with machine learning just started. To respond to your suggestion concerning a fully-connected network, the beauty of CNN's is that different positions of the features don't hinder the network from performing. So even if a fully-connected structure would solve the problem of accurately representing information from the image, it would make the classification task undoable due to the variance of the training set.,2017-11-11T05:29:27.857,10783
6884,4486,"0",Hi eric! I have generated a (pseudo)random key of the same length as the image with values in the range of 0-255 and then applied it to every single image in the dataset. From my perspective, because the network would see hundreds of thousands of images encoded with the same key, it could draw conclusions about which encoded pixels correlate with other encoded pixels in a sequence of images. But, as Neil mentioned above, CNN is not the right way to go on that, because optically, the noise doesn't make sense.,2017-11-11T05:40:05.210,10783

6887,4465,"1",This wouldn't be supervised learning because there isn't any labeled data. The agent wouldn't have any idea what signals mean so couldn't tell a distance sensor from a thermometer. What the agent is learning is predictions of signals based on other signals, which is itself a model of its world.,2017-11-11T14:35:02.227,4398

6890,4491,"0",@zooby I don't think it needs to be lower than normal, but deep NNs often have low values e.g. 0.001 or 0.0001 and use gradient adjustment (RMSProp seems to be a popular choice for LSTM) with mini-batches (which will smooth out some of the differences),2017-11-11T21:19:25.643,1847

6893,4465,"1",with a model-based approach, the agent learns to predict the next state, per your original explanation. it does so by learning <x, y>, where x is (s1, action) and y is (s2, reward). sorry if im misinterpreting, but isnt that supervised learning?,2017-11-12T13:30:37.413,10720
6894,4465,"0",No, tho I see where I may've been confusing. Temporal difference (TD) learning is very different from supervised learning (SL) because each successive sample (state) is related to the previous and not IID, which is often an assumption in supervised learning (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/213464/on-the-importance-of-the-i-i-d-assumption-in-statistical-learning). Although it may be possible to predict the next state of a simple domain using SL, it may not have the expressiveness for a long timeframe like "the state in 100 timesteps", something TD can do with a different gamma.,2017-11-12T14:04:43.380,4398

6940,4548,"0",It will be interesting to see the types of tests that come out of the cognitive science field, should such systems emerge.  I suspect the question will remain in the area of metaphysics for a good long time, regardless.  The better sci-fi authors/philosophers have grappled with this question, Phillip Dick in particular.  In some ways, you might cast his view in context of the "[Duck Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test)". *(I wouldn't be surprised if there is strong sentiment for the idea that "if it talks like a person, and acts like a person, then it's probably a person";)*,2017-11-20T02:01:09.333,1671

6945,4532,"0",@DukeZhou Thanks for the welcome! You are right autonomous vehicles are one area, another domain which is discussed much is (lethal) autonomous weapon systems, and some on health care robots (since bioethics has very clear ethical principles that are used for implementations). I would consider cooperative behavior only when explicit ethical norms are involved (e.g. about lying or altruism).,2017-11-20T11:46:10.060,10958
6946,4532,"1",@antlersoft interesting approach. A subfield of ethics, applied ethics, looks at how to apply ethical theories, usually in specific domains (e.g. business ethics, bioethics). Machine ethics is one of those applied fields, so it seems there are some practical implementations possible. For example, case-based ethics or particularism has been implemented in simple forms, as have generalism/principle based ethics. It seems your suggestions can account for the lack of implementations a bit, but not entirely.,2017-11-20T11:55:26.900,10958
6947,4559,"0",An interesting point you raise here is basically, which measures can be used to test the system, and how do you determine if the system is performing accurately? This is something that is missing in the field, and I feel is part of the problem indeed: how to test your system without ground truth? Which (dimensions in) measures make sense in the context of explicit ethical algorithms? Without that, you have no way of comparing systems, which limits progress in the field.,2017-11-20T12:02:19.790,10958
6948,4552,"0",There seems to be a need for explicit ethics, at least many researchers call for advancement of explicit ethics (e.g. [Moor 2006](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1667948/)). 

In terms of proper application of theoretical frameworks, you might be right: implementation implies some interpretation in some cases, which can prove difficult. However, you agree that safe guidelines for AI are important, which means practical guidelines on what we consider to be 'right' or 'ethical' for our machines to do. These guidelines will imply how to implement ethics in machines in some way.,2017-11-20T12:07:46.790,10958

If this isn't a problem for your application (it'll only ever run in one country), you could assume a reference size for the plate. You would have to be careful still though, because the plate may not be oriented normally to you. If the car is at 45 degrees, the width of the plate will take up fewer pixels than at 0, even at the same distance.,2017-11-20T18:00:07.590,8829

6997,4585,"0",@k.c.sayz'k.csayz' intelligence does seem to be measurable in relation to other intelligences, in some cases.  (For instance, we were easily able to rank our old-school game AIs by having them play against each other.)  But I take your overall point. At best, intelligent measurement will always be necessarily subjective.,2017-11-28T01:39:52.543,1671
6998,4585,"0",@DukeZhou is a subjective measure the greater or lesser the grounds on quantity unless the measure you have is a judgement based upon differences another has from yourself based upon the quality of each difference. Can you say that it's very difficult to judge intelligence simply because we have no concise definition of intelligence itself. A task I would say is itself is very important in determining whether we can simulate it in a machine based upon that definition.,2017-11-28T21:12:34.797,9094
6999,4597,"0",Recently I read a bit about GANs. It seems like VAEs are sometimes used as the generator for GANs and the noisy images are often used as the input prior for the generator.,2017-11-28T21:23:34.400,8499
7000,4585,"0",@Bobs I think the Computer Science definition of intelligence is pretty solid in the sense that it's a gauge of performance in a given task or set of tasks, where objectives are defined and results can be gauged.  "Strong narrow AI" has been recently used to connote an AI that outperforms a human in a specific task, such a game, or outperforms weaker algorithms, such as in managing air-conditions systems.  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is much broader, and connotes a hypothetical AI that performs on a human level or better on any given task.,2017-11-28T21:23:43.603,1671
7001,4585,"0",People, including Turing, have made the point that we likely don't need to fully understand the human mind to simulate it, and likewise, it's clear we don't need an absolute measure for intelligence in order to generate it.  At the most basic level, intelligence can be said to emerge in nature at the most basic biological level, expressed in evolutionary processes.  Evolutionary Game Theory and Genetic Algorithms extend this into the computing context.  Deep learning can be understood as a form of self-evolution for algorithmic intelligence.,2017-11-28T21:28:43.417,1671
7002,4585,"0",@DukeZhou I did not know that about Turing but that's precisely my point simulated intelligence may come from a something not attributable to intelligence. If we say intelligence is an evolutionary process and results from genetic programming inherent in nature then this process did not result from intelligence but from a fundamental property in nature and thus a simulation would also arise from a similar process unless you say that the evolutionary process itself had some predetermination in its making.,2017-11-28T21:38:30.067,9094
7003,4585,"0",@Bobs I tend to agree that intelligence is a function of nature, and that the current extension of intelligence into a computing context is also a natural function.  Intelligence is clearly not an attribute unique to humans--animals have varying degrees of intelligence--we just have the most complex brains on the planet, and thus tend to gauge other intelligences based on our own.  Turing formalized this in the modern era, but it goes back to the early philosopher Protagoras who stated that "Man is the measure of all things".,2017-11-28T21:53:12.223,1671
7004,4597,"0",@Wangsta That could work too — NNs are universal approximators, so with the right input, output, and hyper parameters, any architecture should work. It all depends on what information you have and how much computing power / training time you can afford.,2017-11-28T22:03:01.640,190
7005,4585,"0",@DukeZhou "Tell that to the man who lives in hell !!" no sorry just quoting a lyric. From your answer can the AI that outperforms human chess players perform any other task. The game of chess surely has a limit in the amount of states that the game can be in and the process of defeating an opponent requires a knowledge of all of the following states which lead to a successful win determined by the first move, a task a computer undoubtedly would be superior in because it could calculate those outcomes by the nature of the rules of that game and the world those rules govern.,2017-11-28T22:09:27.630,9094
7006,4585,"0",Actually, the full game tree for Chess cannot be expressed with current computing, and "perfect play", a concept related to Combinatorial Game Theory for "solved games", was not a factor.  The Go gametree can likely never be fully expressed, even if all matter in the universe were turned into a computer.  All we can say is that AlphaGo performed more optimally than Lee Sedol in 4/5 games.  AlphaGo and DeepBlue are "strong narrow AI", only good at one task, and distinct from AGI, good at any task.  A milestone for AGI would be outperforming humans at all tasks humans engage in.,2017-11-28T22:25:32.087,1671
7007,4585,"0",@DukeZhou I knew it would be large but to be argumentative the game of chess the world has boundaries an assumption of which the universe the game of life occurs in doesn't and we haven't got an absolute model of the rules the inhabitants are subject to. I guess the chess AI thus followed a heuristic in its descision making from my limited knowledge.

7041,4625,"0",@nbro: As it is now, this site is an excellent resource concerning weak AI, which is a rapidly developing, highly profitable and efficient field of science and industry.,2017-12-01T13:36:07.373,38
7042,4625,"0",Honestly, if that's a joke, it is bad, given that this website is far from being an "excellent resource" for weak AI. You may be confusing this website with https://stats.stackexchange.com/, which is a reasonably good (but also far from being excellent) resource. But I don't want to digress much and more, in this place, about this topic.,2017-12-01T13:39:38.780,2444

7050,4645,"1",They have eliminated it because in comparing probability for best outcome, it would just introduce additional division and the divisor `p(x)` is same for all candidates. For example, if I tell you to compare the largest of the following numbers: 3/2, 5/2, 1/2, you will without thinking pick 5/2 since the divisors are same and 5 is greatest of all.,2017-12-02T16:37:02.960,1807

7054,4643,"1",When you say "back propagate" you mean via the eligibility trace or lambda return, in order to set the TD target? Or do you literally mean that you back propagate reward signals to the NN for the end position? Are you also using some kind of forward/planning search with alpha/beta pruning?,2017-12-02T20:01:48.690,1847
7056,4643,"2",Hi @neil I'm back propagating after every move, NN plays both sides. I adjust the weights and eligibility traces for the current state using the previous states values according to https://web.archive.org/web/20100625030049/http://www.cse.unr.edu/robotics/bekris/cs482_f09/sites/cse.unr.edu.robotics.bekris.cs482_f09/files/backgammon.pdf At the terminal state I change 'y1' in the above equations to be either `0` for a draw or `+-1` for win/lose. I use a 2-ply search to find the best move to make based upon the average value of all the opponents possible response move.,2017-12-02T22:04:44.590,2819

7065,4647,"1",@LastIronStar I did read the article but since you are conditioning the question on a standard of accountability that is not clear to me (maybe it is a well defined term in your country) it would be helpful to disambiguate the term with a definition or perhaps an example,2017-12-03T20:40:40.843,10368
7066,4619,"0",Interesting take, the profit aspect! Hadn't thought of that since I was so focused on the research reasons, but it makes sense that there is no pressure from industry either for research to pursue it further.,2017-12-04T08:33:06.253,10958
7067,4655,"0",Interesting question. You want to treat you inputs as a set rather than a vector. Assuming your inputs are scalar or otherwise comparable, did you consider sorting your inputs to create a permutation-invariant canonical representation and feeding that to a regular network?,2017-12-04T15:15:10.053,10368
7069,4619,"0",@SuzanneTolmeijer Thanks.  I've been delving into how game theory connects to ethics for a few years now.  (Mostly early philosophy where, for instance, "balance" was said to be the "good"--balance is an equilibrium function and can be precisely, mathematically defined. It relates to economics in that stability is generally understood to be optimal, where instability is potentially catastrophic.) But I'm not the only AI contributor who has touched on economic drivers in this field, and the potential dangers of what I'm terming "hyperpartisan AI".,2017-12-04T20:45:48.650,1671
7070,4613,"0",Why exactly four values for the score? What do these values exactly represent?,2017-12-04T22:44:54.717,8271
7071,4655,"0",@mjul My inputs are series of bets of clients (each bet is represented by a vector of some cathegorical and continuous variables). I could order them chronologically for example, but as the time spacing between bets for each client is very different, this wouldn't make much sense. This could probably be solved using some function (fixed or learned) of time that would decay the coefficients for each bet. But I think the ordering really doesn't matter in this case so I wanted to try unordered data first, which obviously requires to treat the bets for each client symmetrically.,2017-12-05T08:33:24.027,11359
7072,4666,"0",What do you mean, you settled 1000 categories?,2017-12-05T10:31:06.900,7496

7074,3631,"0",Updated the answer with a link to my paper.,2017-12-05T17:34:20.733,7496
7075,4666,"0",I specified to network/library 1000 different output categories, but in practice I just give 1 to the network. I dont know exactly how Tensorflow/Caffe works, but I think that this value (1000) is used in softmax layer,2017-12-05T17:47:26.513,11289
7076,4667,"0",Thats make a lot of sense. But why loss converges faster if my batch is too small? With sizes lower than 32, the networks converges with just 10% of an epoch (aprox. 100 images),2017-12-05T18:10:29.560,11289
7077,4667,"0",You have less variance when you have a smaller batch size, so the network ignores the noise even faster,2017-12-05T18:23:13.757,7496
7079,4668,"0",I am sorry I marked it as an answer first. There actually is one thing not entirely clear to me. How would one do backpropagation with the last option (one net giving the quality for K actions)?,2017-12-05T21:35:23.863,10364
7080,4672,"1",Welcome to AI!  Could you please review your question, as the second paragraph contains typos and it's hard to discern the precise meaning.  (Also please consider adding the "game-ai" tag, and potentially the "combinatorial-games" tag, as this question would apply to a much wider scope of game in the same class as chess.),2017-12-06T19:37:00.427,1671
7081,4339,"0",I think I might have just misunderstood. I assumed that while running the S step, you were planning to add the sparsity constraint to your re-weighting function to cause low values to be less likely to increase, otherwise setting the values to 0 still allows them to grow during the S step. In my last sentence, when I referred to "constraint" I meant that.,2017-12-07T02:36:06.723,10338
7083,4676,"0",May I ask 1) where did Marvin Minsky went wrong? 2) i suppose AI to classify groups still needs human input on the “group” concept? How far is AI from “invent” the concept? Similar to “recognise” an XOR operation for nim?,2017-12-07T13:28:04.303,11440
7084,4676,"0",Marvin Minsky didn't go wrong. It was just that the readers of his book over interpreted his statements. Yes, I'm not even sure the group classification can be called AI. I don't know when AI will "invent" the concept of a group, nor am I sure what that would even look like.,2017-12-07T14:02:15.827,2227

7086,4655,"0",What is the network output? If the network is permutation invariant, the output will be the same for any order of inputs. Is this what you want?,2017-12-07T17:22:22.140,7496
7087,4678,"0",Welcome to AI!  From what I've been gleaning off of the DL folks, while you might need robust computing to train the algorithm, once it is trained, it would be able to run on a much less robust system.   I'd think the real problem with training in this regard would be the dataset.  I'm guessing frequency of break-in attempts is fairly low, and these types of systems need a huge sample.,2017-12-07T18:36:49.147,1671
7088,4678,"0",So basically the problem lays in a large images dataset (specific for recognizing human shapes) and a powerful hardware to train the neural network.,2017-12-07T18:49:23.817,11451
7089,4678,"0",in term of data sample problems, I was more meaning images/videos of actual break-in and trespassing attempts vs. lawful presence on the property (by the owners, neighbors, friends, etc., even the kids sneaking out at night;)  Lawful presence would be easy, but break-ins are probably statistically rare, even in high-crime areas. So getting a sufficient sample size of break-in attempts sufficient to train a Deep Learning system would probably require a monumental, coordinated effort.,2017-12-07T19:52:50.373,1671
7090,4678,"0",By contrast, simply recognizing a human being, their status & intentions irrelevant, would probably be doable.  So if you're just looking for a system that tells you there is a person in the yard, that's significantly less difficult.,2017-12-07T19:57:57.577,1671
7091,4678,"0",Sorry, I should have started with that. I was thinking about night, probably 3:00 am and with no kids playing around XD. The only presence of a human being in your backyard at 3:00 am it's at least an emergency. Changing the conditions then what do I need now? Of course, if the AI gets a picture (frame) and recognize a human shape the problem then is solved. I guess there is no need for learning about videos of breaking in cases.,2017-12-07T20:17:53.133,11451
7092,4678,"0",In terms of applied ML, that's currently outside my skill set. (I try to keep up on what's going on in the field, but my own AI endeavors are in different areas.)  But I'm pretty sure human-shape recognition is an area of great focus in the field. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, ideally need to make this distinction.,2017-12-07T20:22:09.787,1671

7104,4699,"0",What about situations in which someone is „stuck“ in a way? With reinforcement learning (I believe this would be the one benefitting the most anyways), there are often situations where iterations get wasted because the algorithm gets stuck in a certain local maxima.

7122,4707,"0",The first approach suggested would be infeasible in my case due to the computational complexity. The second on the other hand seems maybe too restrictive. But it is certainly a good start. What I have come  up with so far is approach similar to the one I found in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04530.pdf. First I consider all pairs (generally all k-tuples) of inputs x_i, x_j, i,j in 0 ... n and apply some neural network on all of them (the same nn on each pair). This gives me n**2 outputs f(x_i, x_j) and then I average them (or take maximum) and apply anoter nn over the result.,2017-12-11T20:16:11.903,11359

In these subjects, ( at least till the high school level ), there is no IN DEPTH understanding required, as they're mostly facts. Now, if a software has mastered any of the subjects, we could use it as a kind of teacher for the students. Think of it like " Siri for education ".,2017-12-12T05:07:50.967,11506

7144,4694,"0",Hi this has been mulling around in my head, is a consequence of your question whether a human imitating another human would they fail the Turing test? Plus are you saying an AI capable of passing the Turing test would believe itself to be human misgiving physical differences if it was unable to observe a human. If a simulation convinces the reciever it's not a simulation isn't that simulation no longer and is real, because you can't distinguish reality from that simulation.

The instructions would need to translated from natural language into machine code in order to achieve the reaction. I think this problem is similar to human converting thought into movement via a medium. The medium an interface from conception to physical action.,2017-12-13T00:21:37.150,9094
7148,4628,"0",@Bobs it depends on what the AI is being asked to do.  It might not necessarily have to code in machine language proper, for instance Python or JS or any computer code would work.  But unless it's using a computer language based on natural language, it would still have to code in code.,2017-12-13T00:25:16.753,1671
7149,4628,"0",Hi again but isn't the machines use of natural language and its composition using a high level language to produce it's reaction, a "realisation" in the method in which it is able to use natural language. Humans in there response do not reference the conception of that language before they are able to respond. They concieve of the response and that thought has an outcome in movement. The programming in the method of natural language would deal with instructions that only needed a verbal conformaty by the program itself because of the nature of it.,2017-12-13T00:41:57.300,9094
7150,4628,"0",@Bobs I suppose you could have the low-level function be autonomic, even where they had the intelligence to translate natural language into machine code, but classical computing will always be based on 1's and 0's, and even quantum computing on qbits, so there's no way to get around the the fact that any instructions are ultimately reduced to a sting, mostly likely in base-2.  On top of that, natural language is inefficient for coding, but even if it were used, it's getting translated into machine language and a binary string.,2017-12-13T02:47:51.710,1671
7151,4731,"0",Thanks for the quick reply. So, is there no real tracking? I believe Kalman filter is using a predictive motion model. So, if I only have 2 frames, I cannot track the object. Also, what if the object is human? I cannot really predict the motion as human may stop and turn around at random time. Any insight to my situations?,2017-12-13T07:32:07.673,11493

But about point 2, conv2d_8 and the 9th layer has same hyper-parameters and those layers don't act as a classifier right? Convolution2D helps in better activation values for edge detection, was just wondering how they arrived at two conv2d layers at later stages of the layer with same hyper-parameters. So playing around with changes in vgg architecture to what gave that thought instead of just one of such layer.

7167,4704,"0",It depends on your input layer. I believe forward-prop isn't too heavy to perform. What's really heavy is the back-prop. It will definitely help if you have a NVidia GPU which does matrix-multiplication fast. I say for "non-mission-critical", if you exam 2-3 frames per seconds, a regular CUDA support graphic card will be enough for forward-prop.,2017-12-14T03:11:19.660,11493
7168,4704,"0",(continue)
Just to put runtime in perspective (please correct me if I am wrong), depending on the number of layers you have, since the separation of concave regions may exist if it is greater than or equal to 3 layers, we can assume 3 layers for the sake of simplifying the calculation.,2017-12-14T03:25:48.043,11493
7169,4704,"0",(continue)
We can also assume that each neuron is a pretty simple function (i.e. sigmoid function), that can be considered as constant O(K) and given that for each step we have n neurons O(n), we can roughly estimate the running time is O(n^2 + K) for this forward prop to run. Therefore, based on the big O rules, we pretty much can assume it is O(n^2).,2017-12-14T03:26:03.557,11493
7170,4704,"0",So, consider you do it in GPU that it runs matrix multiplication in parallel, it is going to be relatively fast! In theory, your CPU shouldn't even spike much because we don't use CPU to process calculation.,2017-12-14T03:27:12.770,11493

One point I'll make, because this appears to be deterministic game, is that you could take a classical approach, and see if you can "solve" the game to identify "perfect play".  My question is: what is your intent?  Are you looking to build the strongest AI possible?  If so, Deep Learning would definitely be the way to go, barring solution of the game.

7190,4757,"0",My high-level answer would be that Chess is still presumed to be unsolvable, the gametree is quite complex, and it's useful to validate algorithms against other algorithms in multiple contexts.  Go may be the most complex "game people play", but based on a recent, reliable poll by yougov, Chess has about 10x the casual player base, and, until recently, was much more famous than Go in the west.  (In tv and movies, Go is starting to replace Chess as the signifier of a character's intelligence or strategic acumen, no doubt a function of AlphaGo, though  the movie π utilized Go in 1998.),2017-12-15T20:43:49.477,1671

I have no idea how to calculate the size of the model but I cannot imagine a few thousands neurons and their weights can fill up Gigabytes of Memory. The Pretrained image recognition model from Google is a few hundred Megs https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition and that can recognize more than most others out there. Apple handles it on-chip in the iPhone so the model itself must be much smaller than the T-data. And that doesn't need to be all in RAM right?,2017-12-16T14:28:00.333,11429

7215,4779,"1",I'm getting downvotes. Please mention the reason too for downvotes. It will be helpful. Thanks,2017-12-19T04:07:30.420,8720
7217,4777,"0",I suppose you could say Q-learning is more general in the sense that it's off-policy yes, which means that you can follow a certain policy (e.g. epsilon-greedy), and learn the Q-values for a different policy (e.g. the greedy policy). This is not possible with policy gradient methods as far as I'm aware, they're always on-policy, meaning they optimize their actions for their current policy. This typically results in slightly ''safer'' behaviour if you're using an epsilon-greedy policy for example, because it takes into account that it will sometimes select completely random actions,2017-12-19T08:38:26.433,1641
7218,4777,"0",Q-learning is indeed typically less sample efficient, because it cannot learn from the n-step return after a sequence of n steps if anywhere within that sequence an action was taken that would not have been taken by the policy you're learning values for. That's in the typical case though, there are ways to improve this (e.g. Retrace(lambda)),2017-12-19T08:39:58.363,1641

7271,4852,"2",Thank you for your answer. I really appreciate it. I think that I've not explained myself very well. In your photos the path is still upwards (or sidewards). They do not turn 180 in both directions. They do left-right but not up-down, or they do up-down but not left-right. I want them to learn that if they pass near a piece of food, they can turn around and get it instead of continuing to the edge and appearing from the other side. If I added a scoring system to penalize the ones that do not turn to get the food, I don't know why I never get a mutation where they do.,2017-12-26T19:24:57.727,11751

7278,4859,"1",I'm not sure what you're asking. To find the minimum in a list, you have to look at every element once, and the simple solution (a for loop scanning the table) is a theoretically optimal O(n). If you get to design circuitry that can read every input at once, you can get that down to O(1) time, though the cost in terms of silicon and complexity would be formidable. Or something like O(log n) pretty simply. In any case, I'm not sure what you're hoping for from a learning algorithm. Can you elaborate?,2017-12-27T14:51:23.880,3365

7331,4898,"0",@OldGeezer – you can certainly train a machine learning model to recognize images and speech, but there are many details and questions to answer, e.g., (a) how much time/expertise do you need to design, build and maintain a model appropriate to your task, (b) how accurate do you need it to be (more accurate is harder), (c) how can you make it both accurate and CPU/power-efficient (e.g., if you run the ML model on a Raspberry Pi, you have limited CPU power; running on a server farm gets you more computational power, running in the cloud on a farm of servers is even more powerful), etc.,2018-01-02T05:42:55.303,1632
7332,4892,"1",Thanks for adding the diagram. This is closer to RNN in design as it involves loops, and thus necessarily some kind of time step parameter in order to decide which value to feed.

There is no value in considering these illegal positions from the standpoint of placement, *but*, an important strategic layer is recognizing which placements minimize value of remaining, unplayed positions. (i.e. if I place an 8 here, it blocks my opponent from placing an 8 in that row, column or region.

7513,5023,"0",You raise a good point and I have read before it's possible that speed improvements may be limited to human intervention (hardware upgrades) while algorithmic efficiency may be drastically improved upon internally. I wonder if there's a limit to efficiency, a least common denominator. 1+1+1+1=4 is inefficient and AI may simplify to 2*2=4 or 2^2=4  but can you simplify an operation indefinitely or is there a lower limit? If an AI can simplify its own 1 million lines of code into 1 line it could be at most 1,000,000x more efficient, but in that case is it still limited to hardware?,2018-01-17T19:41:06.917,12139

You'll also have to contend with poetic constructions "Deer, man eats", etc., nonsense such as "deer eats man", and abstractions "grass eats man" (in the sense of "dust to dust", as fertilizer.),2018-01-25T18:33:26.993,1671

When you can't solve a problem efficiently, often instead you generate a random number and use that number to cheat in some way that allows you to solve the problem efficiently.

Instead, I can generate a random prime with 1000 digits and check if a = b mod p. Calculating a mod p and b mod p can be done really easily, and then to check the comparison I only have to compare 1000 digit numbers, which is a constant independent of a and b. If a and b are actually equal, then they're equal mod p too, but sometimes I'll get the answer wrong by accident because of the algebraic relationship between a and b.,2018-02-14T07:32:05.923,12732

7854,5334,"1",Right, my exploration function was meant as 'upgrade' from a strictly e-greedy strategy (to mitigate thrashing by the time the optimal policy is learned). But I don't get why then it won't work even if I only use it in the action selection (behavior policy). Also the idea of plugging it in the update step I think is to propagate the optimism about exploring not only to the state in question but to states leading to that state. As for separating behavior and learning, shouldn't the behavior be driven from what has been learned so far?,2018-02-16T10:12:35.827,12773
7855,5334,"1",@SaldaVonSchwartz: "the idea of plugging it in the update step I think is to propagate the optimism about exploring" - that sort of works with the function as you have described it, because it cuts out after certain number of actions. Eventually the Q-table will forget the large optimistic starting values due to the fixed learning rate. But really this is the same as behaving randomly to start with (e.g. for 100 steps) then behaving closer to optimally later. You still need some exploration after the exploration function is exhausted, thus need a non-greedy action selection.,2018-02-16T10:47:28.507,1847

7949,1418,"0",Completely agree, and would like to add that most of those ideas were generated before 1990s, before most of modern IT technologies came to existence. Currently it is not unthinkable to imaging nice virtual environment with extensively detailed surroundings, so that AI would not required to be in physical body. Even if it will not be contained in closed virtual world, it will be possible to create such a massive stream of information via multiple channels like web-cams, microphones and numerous APIs, so AI would have enough information to build world model.,2018-02-23T18:56:05.733,12935
7950,5410,"2",Well, reverse engineering human brain is just one of the approaches, which is not supported by majority of AGI researchers, as far as I know. It is nice to understand how human brain works, and to learn from it, but for AGI concept might be completely different. That is why I'm very curious about progress in academic research in area of AGI. Where new concepts are discussed? Who tried some models? Where the most advanced publications?,2018-02-23T19:03:20.583,12935
7952,5410,"3",AGI does not require reverse engineering the human brain--that's simply one approach, but superintelligences not based on current biological brains might be regarded as "alien" intelligences, not in the sense of flying saucers, but as entirely new, non-human sentient species.  I wouldn't at all be surprised if the recent, groundbreaking advances in "strong narrow AI" prove to the the first part of the puzzle.  Even if subsequent algorithmic advances aren't as profound, it might be possible that strong, general AI emerges, simply based on Moore's law in conjunction with Machine Learning.,2018-02-23T21:54:17.830,1671

Basically imperfect algorithms which aren't predictable by anyone. Due to common buerocratic institutions, no single human runs it typiclly. Therefore one can argue no human is in charge but simply fills some role often well defined by rules. Therefore an algorithm.

At a rough guess (not good enough for an answer) I would say 2 convolutional layers, and an FC/dense hidden layer should be good enough (so 3 hidden layers total). I suggest the convolutional layers because they will train a lot faster due to less parameters and weight sharing. However, I don't know if convnets work well with evolving architectures. HyperNEAT has a solution for this, but I have never looked into what it actually does.,2018-02-26T14:55:48.993,1847

8071,5492,"0",@pasaba so how does machine translation work without being taught the grammar? The goal is NOT to translate the whole path at once but parts of the path - for example, the CNN could be generating three rights which can be replaced by one left. Perhaps a picture by OP will help. I am trying to work within the constraints of OP and you are proposing a completely new approach which is likely better but not what OP is constrained to.,2018-03-03T19:45:07.033,10287

8078,5508,"1",The example of 100MB data and entropy is great, thank you. But 10 weights is not enough only if the order of data is important and each entry is different. for example if 100mb of data like y=x*2+1 are generated 10 weights enough to learn the true concept.

8079,5508,"0",Nice answers both of you guys, thanks. 
I'm still not able to make clear conclusion. Presumably it depends on the underlying function, which is not known.

8150,5522,"2",Solid answer.  I'm not entirely convinced "singularity" is the right word for the definitions given, which is not to impugn Von Neumann, Goode or anyone else.  Just that the after reading the Causal Angel by mathematical phycist Rajaniemi, who uses game theory to relate intelligence acceleration to the topology of blackholes, I feel like the term "singularity" should be more specific than mere "runaway superintelligence."  i.e. why this term in particular?,2018-03-06T20:35:32.950,1671

8157,5530,"1",Trust me, you're are looking for an episodic memory (aka case-based reasoning). Because the NEAT algorithm needs a cost-function, otherwise he can't convergate to a policy. And trying out all possible neural networks with a 2 Ghz PC isn't possible. Finding a cost function for NEAT is called in literature “inverse reinforcement learning”, and is done with expert-demonstrations.,2018-03-07T07:27:07.943,11571

Concerning "computational savings versus applying independent evaluations" from the discussion: There are heuristics in game engines giving preference to moves which were shown to be good in other parts of the search tree. This is like to "go through the kingside defensive lines again [... but ...] a lot faster" (again from the discussion). No idea if Alpha Go uses / could use such heuristics. I guess, my comment is only loosely related to your question, but aims at the same goal.,2018-03-08T07:12:45.443,12053
8177,5530,"1",@Alexus: Adjusting the fitness function is exactly the goal which results into a working controller. A possible implementation uses domain knowledge for guiding the neuroevolution process. [(1) page 5](http://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1734&context=ecuworks) The main problem with a vanilla fitness function is the delayed reward. That means the learning controller get only unqualified feedback.,2018-03-08T07:51:29.020,11571

8180,2322,"0",I agree that understanding the meaning of the text is the hard part. Just a simple sentence: "Peter went to the cinema." contains a lot of hidden information: Peter is male, he most probably went there to watch a film with his girlfriend, his location changed, etc... Building a model for example a graph based on the text is not enough, because it is not something static, it can describe multiple timelines, events and contexts, plus there is hidden information in every sentence you can infer and use to understand the previous or following sentences.,2018-03-08T13:25:39.607,13192

I've done some digging after I posted this question and found one video where Joseph Redmon(author of the paper) gives a presentation about YOLO: https://youtu.be/NM6lrxy0bxs . Somewhere about 8 min he starts to explain how they train the network and it seems like my initial assumption is rights: 1^{obj}_{ij}=1 only when the center of the ground truth box falls into i cell. Also, it seems like 1^{noobj}_{ij}=1 for every cell where there is no center of ground truth box.,2018-03-08T15:47:16.817,13102

8221,5607,"0",thanks for the reply. I'm still confused though. So from your reply, for dL/dw5 I end the chain rule with a do1/dw5 but for dL/dw1 I skip the do1/dw5 and instead do do1/dah1 to continue propagating back? Or are you saying that both for w5 and for w1 the chain of derivatives is the same at the node in question?,2018-03-10T04:17:39.483,12773
8222,5607,"0",@SaldaVonSchwartz ya I am saying you have to skip dw5/dw1 because they are independent variables, so w5 is not dependent on w1...its kind of like ur predicting the change of weather w.r.t to the food you eat where w5 is the change of weather and w1 is the food you eat...it doesn't make mathematical sense...also I think the part you are mistaking is  the view you are giving to w5...w5 is just an attachment whereas an activation function is a tunnel...you have to go through the tunnel to reach a place...you don't have to go through w5 to reach w1..get it? the image maybe kinda misrepresenting,2018-03-10T04:43:40.907,9947
8223,5607,"0",yeah I see what you mean about the image, cause the weights should be more like dead end lines into the circles. But then for w5 you have to end the chain rule at do1/dw5 and for w1 you instead skip that derivative and at do1 do do1/dah1 right? I want to confirm this. The implication for my implementation is that I need conditional logic there to do one derivative or the other depending on wether I am solving for w5 or w1. Can you confirm this? thanks.,2018-03-10T05:30:02.900,12773
8224,5607,"0",let me clarify my previous question. I am aware that w5 does not depend on w1 and that to get the partial derivative of loss for w1, w5 would be treated as constant and disappear. I'm trying to confirm that then, I cannot just apply chain rule from L2 all the way to x1 and get the partials of both w1 and w5 in one go without conditional logic. Rather, I will need to differentiate up to o1 and at that point, save do1/dw5 and then keep differentiating from do1/dah1 onwards to get to h1 and do dh1/dw1. Is this correct? This is about figuring if I can code it without testing for this condition.,2018-03-10T06:09:58.173,12773
8225,5607,"0",@SaldaVonSchwartz yes correct....but in NN's we don't use conditional logic due to the small number of layers....I am sure you know about the nice vectorized implementations,2018-03-10T08:33:45.007,9947

8234,5577,"1",@DukeZhou I haven't used any ML library yet. I need to decide first what tool I could use to complete this task. I am afraid that using some kind of hardcoded approach for the parser will be too rigid, and won't work in some of the environments, that's why I am thinking on using ML, but I have zero experience with it. What I need is some pattern recognition algorithm, which will be able to recognize the variable and constant regions of the stack string, and if the pattern does not match by a new stack string or probably by a frame string, then it will adapt to it.,2018-03-10T12:35:58.563,13192

8244,5620,"1",@Eka yes...that is pretty much the concept of how partial derivatives are calculated,2018-03-10T16:38:20.307,9947
8245,5577,"1",Interesting question. One approach is  "grammar induction". All strings you present they have the form " Header Frame ... Frame "  where "Frame" contains common parts / structures as "Line N", "of F". Grammar induction will find how to extract these items from the string.,2018-03-10T16:47:01.880,12630
8246,5577,"1",@pasabaporaqui Yes, there are rules we can assume, for example every stack has a possibly multiline header (or footer) with at least the message. Every frame contains at least a path. Frame string formats can be different depending on the variables, e.g. in example B. if the called function is not set, then there are no parentheses around the location variables. I think the hardest part is separating a different frame string template from an unknown variable.,2018-03-10T18:43:28.423,13192
8247,5619,"1",Why turn to AI for this?  If you were a soldier you would have been taught these things but they would be very clear and easy to define.  It would be overkill to use an AI approach to mimic this unless you have lots of videos of soldiers getting into many different formations and you find that you aren't able to write rules or develop simple models or definitions.  I am assuming by 'order' you mean 'formation'.  You didn't give a number on how many formations you are considering but my guess is it is fairly small (e.g. less than 20).  If that is the case just define them in a file or database.,2018-03-10T20:20:19.930,5763

8262,5621,"0",Not quite, IMO. If you take a bunch of different linear combinations of the input in the first layer then you will have many different types of curves available to piece together in the next layer, again with more linear combinations. This can make for a flawless output. Imagine for example if you cut and pasted the curves together only at their local extrema. Then the resulting curves would be almost perfectly continuous. It also depends exactly how fine you want the output to be. It's true though that there are better activation functions than ReLU due to their excessive linearity (e.g. ELU),2018-03-11T18:50:19.060,13208

8270,5621,"0",@DuttaA The input number line is a straight line and the output number line is a straight line, but that doesn't say anything about the shape of the data on the number line.

8272,5621,"0",Well we don't have a curve in input data..Like I gave the example of sine wave, if we had the curve already in input data then a simple straight line would be much more effective than relu i believe,2018-03-12T02:47:54.290,9947

8275,5621,"0",That's true, but you could still get around that problem by applying a curve transformation to the input data. If your input data is y=x and the output data is y=sin(x), then you can just square or cube your input data and ReLU will be able to piece it together into a sine curve much more easily. That's similar to the reason why people add x^2 and x^3, and so on to their feature matrix for linear regression.,2018-03-12T03:02:09.417,13208

8344,5683,"0",@DuttaA Quite the contrary in my opinion. In biological evolution an organism could in theory transform back to something close to a previous form, if the selection pressure pushed it that way (a changing ecosystem means a changing definition of "fitness"). In contrast, with artificial evolution we are solving a specific problem so the "ecosystem" (the problem) is static, as is its objective. This means that since our solutions are getting fitter and fitter in relation to this static objective, it is unlikely that our method will drive us towards past solutions which we have already explored.,2018-03-15T16:19:22.197,12857

8348,5683,"0",@DuttaA I think your hypothesis is somewhat flawed. Take the Mexican tetra, for example. This fish has two forms: the "normal" form which lives where light is abundant and which has eyes, and the "cave" form which lives in total darkness and whose eyes have been removed over time by selection pressure. Having eyes is not necessarily better, it really all depends on the environment. So the cave form of the Mexican tetra at one point was some kind of multicellular organism without eyes, then evolved into a fish with eyes, then evolved into a fish without eyes.,2018-03-15T18:06:16.260,12857

8428,5756,"2",Well done on train and test split and scaling. However, @stain also asked about validation set. Some packages (eg most of Keras supervised learning algorithms) can consider a portion (by with absolute or relative size) of training set as the validation set.

For example, I'm not aware whether Shor and Grover work on this model! So, talking about "2,000+ qubits" is a bit misleading: computers in the model where we _care_ about the qubit count have something around 50 qubits as the current frontier.,2018-03-21T13:28:24.523,14451

This isn't actually shown in the image and in fact to me that image kind of suggests that it's the same weights applied to each channel (since their the same color)...

The game is not too complicated, there can be an N number of players, to which all cards in the deck are distributed in the beginning. For example 4 players mean each will start with 13 cards, and the winner is the first to have no cards in hand. To get rid of the cards they will play them in turn order and can choose to play cards or not play. The only rules are  that the players always have to play higher cards than  previously played.,2018-03-27T12:47:32.513,12217
8529,5798,"0",(Part 2 of the Comment) Once no one wants to play a card (or can't), the last player to play a card gets to play any card he wants and start a new cycle. 
The game is highly stochastic because the players can start with low level cards and lose the game even if they played better than the opposition, which complicates the use of greedy epsilon exploration.,2018-03-27T12:54:09.387,12217

8581,5025,"0",@DuttA: Sure it has, for any practical purpose. Circuits measuring thermal noise or shot noise are "true random" for any practical measure. You won't get "more random" in terms of being unable to predict, and these things do essentially measure the environment to achieve the result. Maybe it is worth a separate question, but to get further than unpredictable + not a PRNG + statistically random, you need to define terms.,2018-03-31T20:16:11.190,1847
8582,5025,"0",@Neil Slater if you consider noise as randomness it's quite vague then...Everything has noise... Quantum physics say we can't measure things with 100% accuracy..So there's noise..But that's useless for any practical purpose..The hardware (PUF) used to generate randomness for cryptographic purpose is also not random even if it theoretically should be..So again as long as we can't convert noise to a digital form it's useless for any practical purpose,2018-03-31T21:07:13.093,9947

Say we want to detect fraudulent transactions and assume 99% of transactions are non-fraudulent. A model could get 99% precision on predicting non-fraudulent transactions by always predicting transactions to be non-fraudulent. This is essentially what we would be doing by generating values.

8625,5269,"1",I think you have mis-characterized swarm intelligence in your second paragraph. You seem to suggest that there's a "hive mind agent" that aggregates information from all the ants ("information must be matched together") and makes decisions, when it's actually quite the opposite. Each ant takes locally useful actions completely independently of the others, and these actions interact in such a way that complex, intelligent behavior emerges.,2018-04-02T18:11:49.923,2841

8628,5835,"0",In which case, although Q learning should work without errors, you would be expending resources for the agent to learn the fact that the action does not influence state. Your situation is more commonly known as "contextual bandit" and there a variety of solvers out there. The positive news is that good old supervised learning should be fine to learn from the historical data. Then it's just a matter of how online your algorithm needs to be, and how risk averse whilst making online decisions.,2018-04-02T19:11:02.360,1847

8635,5873,"2",I can't say much more than what I have written. In a conversation that I followed, I understood that removing IDs from connections simplifies code. The one drawback that was mentioned is what I already said here, about not being able to track connections between the same nodes at different times.

He is currently refactoring all the code and brought up this topic, so maybe you can reach him if you have more doubts! https://github.com/colgreen/sharpneat-refactor,2018-04-03T14:50:45.873,14744

8649,5872,"0",Nice answer. *(Would be better with links to the data, but interesting nonetheless.)*  At a high level, I'm sensing processing speed and throughput are only part of the problem, and this aspect relates more to time than anything else (i.e. how long to process for a given decision.)

  Ex :  **Offmythrone,jester.Thekingsitsthere.** = **Off my throne, jester.

8655,5868,"1",@DuttaA That's a fair point because, in the typical bot swarm, aren't the agents all identical.  (How this changes if each bot is self-evolving, I can only guess...)  Regarding intelligence, that can be defined many ways, and is always a spectrum.  One of the definitions of intelligence is simply information.  You might have an algorithmic intelligence in the form of a string.  When processing, it can demonstrate that intelligence.  But the simple encoded state of the information as a string represents a form of intelligence, regardless of whether it is processing.,2018-04-03T21:04:37.147,1671

8667,5868,"0",@DuttaA You seem to have the assumption that human cognition is an emergent property with sufficient complexity. This concept was used in the novel, "The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress" for the sentient computer. Unfortunately, it is incorrect. It doesn't matter how many swarm or AI agents you have, they will never match human cognition. That requires a completely different theory.
The concept of collective intelligence for things like bacteria or nanobots can be disproved so there isn't much point to discuss them.,2018-04-04T16:28:19.227,12118
8668,5868,"0",Uh huh..I disagree with that point of view... Intelligence is a.lot dependent on the community..Many isolated tribes have almost very less advancement in technology? Why?

8669,5872,"0",@DukeZhou Links added. No, you are quite mistaken. The claim that the brain is just a Turing Machine can be disproved. Also, I wouldn't use the term 'breakthrough' for a system that can be beaten by a six month old baby.,2018-04-04T16:54:13.143,12118
8670,5885,"0",@DuttaA per the reference question, I was careful to avoid the term "swarm", because, even though emergence is tagged, I'm thinking more about extensions of classical expert systems, as opposed to bot networks.  *(Glad I got at least one upvote though--wasn't sure what the reaction would be.  But we haven't had a lot of theoretical questions lately, so I figured, "why not?".)*,2018-04-04T17:31:21.550,1671
8671,5868,"0",@DuttaA What does a tribe have to do with a swarm? A tribe is a collection of cognitive agents since humans are cognitive agents. I don't quite understand what you think I'm denying. I will say again that a collection of AI or swarm agents cannot match a cognitive system. And, I don't see how you can argue against this by using cognitive agents.,2018-04-04T17:38:12.047,12118

8676,5891,"2",Welcome to AI!  Interesting question.  I find it interesting that machine learning is performing so well with perfect information games, where indeterminacy is purely a function of complexity (intractability).  Uncertainty arising from imperfect or incomplete information is distinct, and minimax is the hedge.  CGT initially was focused only on perfect information games, until Fergusson (UCLA) and other started analyzing poker, so it may just be a matter of time before we see strong, narrow reinforcement learning producing the same results in this broader class of games...,2018-04-04T17:58:15.203,1671

8679,5893,"0",Richard Garfield defines luck as "uncertainty in outcomes".  Athough I don't necessarily love this definition for the term (speaking as a deterministic game designer) his point is well taken when he applies this to non-trivial, non-chance, perfect information games such as Chess.  (Essentially it's an extension of the "infinite monkey theorem" applied to unsolved games.  Because perfect play cannot be validated, there is always a chance, however minuscule, of being beaten by an opponent making purely random choices.),2018-04-04T18:32:10.420,1671

Theoretically, it could be that option 2 would work better because you can view it as a sort of multi-task learning. For instance, differentiating not only between person and dog, but between person, labrador, terrier, rotweiler, etc. may force the network to learn better features that will then benefit the task that you are interested in - detecting the person - as well.,2018-04-05T09:07:51.647,14789

They not only overlap (algorithmically and NN/ML techniques), but are not complete (NN/ML techniques - why NN explicitly? Do you mean simply ML?).,2018-04-06T09:01:31.330,4880
8740,5840,"0",Also, when you say NN is not giving an exact solution you seem to focus on function approximation. But when you have a NN with 1-hot output for classification it does give an exact solution.,2018-04-06T09:28:51.757,4880
8742,5840,"0",@BartoszKP nah...NN's have a lot lesser accuracy than 100% unless exact solution is found out,2018-04-06T10:20:58.827,9947
8743,5840,"0",@DuttaA Depends on your data and particular application.,2018-04-06T10:31:06.410,4880
8744,5926,"0",But local minima will always exist. Arguably, with 4 hidden neurons there will be many more local minims than with 2, correct? So why then does it become less likely to get stuck in one?,2018-04-06T11:28:45.047,14789
8745,5917,"0",You did not misunderstand the question, but I am using JS, and Synaptic.js at that. The documentation is [here](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic/wiki). I am unable to use Keras, for I am not using Python.,2018-04-06T11:49:26.180,14723

8748,5917,"0",I think I have it down. Just one more question: Does the embedding layer mean that it turns text into something the NN can understand, such as floating point numbers, while the output layer turns that back into text?,2018-04-06T12:05:04.097,14723
8749,5926,"0",The local minima don't necessarily increase with more neurons (although they might!). Despite that, they're harder to find, because you have more dimensions, and it must be a minimum on all of those. So, a local minimum with XY just needs to be a local minimum for XY, while with 100 neurons, you'd need it to be a minimum on all 100 dimensions for backprop to settle there.,2018-04-06T12:07:53.850,7496
8751,5926,"0",okay if the number of local minima grows slow enough with the number of hidden neurons this makes sense. Thanks for your answer! Do you know if there are any good materials out there discussing these things. That is, what the optimisation "landscape" looks like and how it is likely to change with the complexity of the network?,2018-04-06T13:29:42.347,14789
8752,5926,"0",IIRC David Silver mentions the robustness of neural nets in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0) course, but I couldn't find the precise moment. He basically describes that the net has so many parameters it makes it robust to local minima. On visualizing the landscape, it's impossible with enough inputs. You could do it with your 2 input neurons, but more than that cannot be represented visually for humans. I made a workshop and mention some displays [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eoaj9wfxifmgnbf/NN%20Workshop.pptx),2018-04-06T13:46:38.770,7496

8754,5917,"0",@Pheo, yes you are correct, it turns each word into a stream of numbers, often times a vector. This is what Word2Vec and GloVe does, which you can load into your model in python. And then the last layer looks at these and can choose the output in a variety of ways, these are known as decoders.

8758,5893,"0",@murthy10: I am less sure about multi-player scenarios, and do not have much advice. If the team objective is to win as a unit, and players can share information freely, then it could make sense to model the team as an agent (as opposed to each player separately). However, if you want to code a game agent that could play as a team member alongside a human player, that would not work.,2018-04-06T17:29:41.863,1847

Since I couldn't really figure out described problem I decided to go with multiple networks for multiple actions. So I wrote an environment similar to open ai gym, with 5 different actions (bet, insure, split, double, hit) at different timesteps. I use a DQN (openai baselines) as network for each of these actions.

I usually recommend taking a quick look at computational complexity theory, to get a sense of the problems sizes for problems where all of the parameters are known and information is perfect and complete. Compare to nature, where this is not the case.  It's a very challenging problem. Good question, though.  Welcome to AI!,2018-04-10T20:18:23.337,1671

8857,5987,"2",As usually the main goal of training an NN is to generalise a function from example data, could you clarify what you mean by "forgetting the first data point"? Are you wanting to purposefully overfit so that predictions against the first data point are no better than random? If not, do you have any criteria for when the training for any specific model e.g. "model 2 trained on 1-100" is complete, or whether its results are acceptable to you? It is clearly possible to take model 1 and re-train it, but what is missing in the question is the goal for doing so . . . and that affects the answer here,2018-04-10T22:00:12.823,1847
8858,5987,"0",The idea is that the first data point is not relevant any more. I dont want overfit, so imagine continuous addition of data points. For a given situation, only the 100 most recent data points are relevant. When a data point is added, the most recent model is trained on a data point that is (in theory) not relevant any more.,2018-04-10T22:15:39.107,14923
8859,5987,"0",Adding to my comment, essentially Im asking if it is possible for a model to only consider the most recent data points, without retraining the model from the bottom on the most recent data - only partially traning it in some way, making it "forget" the no longer relevant data form the previous training set.,2018-04-10T23:16:35.173,14923

8873,5987,"0",Thank you so much for all of your time. I should clarify by describing the problem I want to solve instead of wasting your time, sorry.
I want to predict some future event. My hypothesis is that only the last 6 hours are relevant,so when time passes, the model will be trained with "old" data. The idea is that there will be some pattern present in the data that will help predict the next event.
So I need an adaptive model that "forgets" the old (non-relevant) data without retraining it from the bottom every time a time unit passes, because of real-time (every 5th min),2018-04-11T08:08:29.913,14923

8877,5987,"0",@norflow: It is *still* not clear from your comment. Are you saying items 0-99 are being used together to predict something about item 100? As you describe the training data, I am expecting each item (e.g. item 25) to be a separate valid input to the network, with a fixed training target. So input data about item 25 into the network, what is the output? Is the output associated only with item 25, and the rules for association changing over time? Or would it be more accurate to say the the output depends on items 0-24 as well, so this is more about predicting outcome of a *sequence*?,2018-04-11T08:21:37.697,1847
8878,5987,"0",I think some simplified examples will help. Please make it clear how older items become less relevant. In a practical sense, there is a difference between a non-stationary problem (where the rules of induction keep changing) or a sequence prediction problem (where the history of the data has a predictable consequence and is part of those rules).,2018-04-11T08:23:54.437,1847
8879,5872,"0",@maaartinus You don't understand. Artificial intelligence has zero comprehension. It doesn't have actual learning since learning is impossible without comprehension or understanding.

But in the case of a problem set like M, every time you increase the matrix base or add dimensions, the problem size expands exponentially *and* factorially, and M can't be reduced to the degree that Sudoku can because the elements have weights (i.e. it's an ACGT/minimax problem, not exclusively combinatorics.)

2. If a given solution is composed of multiple steps, and you could therefore break down the search into a search from the solution to the start combined with a search from the start to the solution, is the problem not decomposable? Again, my quabble is with what formally qualifies.

9175,6168,"1",@DukeZhou This is a matlab representation of 2 layer NN. it stats with inputs (green box), the input is a vector 2x1, these inputs are passed to 2 artificial neurons through weights "w", summed up "+" and passed through activation function "bipolar sigmoid". The Layer 2 is an output layer, doing the same, but the output is just linear (in other words, there is no specific activation function because for linear function input=output).,2018-04-26T03:56:16.313,15231
9176,6168,"1",I recommend to learn the matlab toolkit, it is simple, provides all information (can print all the weights) and you can supervise the learning process. Or, just code it on your own, 2 layer NN is simple and you can check all the values on your own. DONT use biases for this simple case, that is just adding more hyper parameters.,2018-04-26T03:58:11.430,15231

So if I understand correctly, a CNN would be more suitable than a decision tree for computer vision, because CNNs can represent features the same way regardless of location within the image, whereas decision trees can only represent a 'group of pixels' rather than the higher-level idea of features because the lack the convolution and pooling layers.,2018-04-27T02:51:25.213,9983

9198,6190,"0",Thank you very much for the answer. Just the issue is, there can be infinitely many topics for the user to ask. And sure, many topics can be added in a similar way but is it possible to develop an algorithm that breaks down questions starting from "how" or "what" into words, which can be saved into variables and then processed as you showed above?,2018-04-27T12:51:49.310,4869
9200,6190,"2",I'm afraid this is probably not possible. I work professionally with dialog systems, and that is how we do it. Infinite topics are not really feasible, especially if you're doing it all by yourself. You would need a lot of information to recognise that "Bristol" is a city (could also be a football club), and that you are talking about travel (but then you're got limited topics again).,2018-04-27T13:13:55.110,2193
9201,6189,"1",If I do it with C++ then can I get fast execution than python and what's about the performance level because it is stated that : C++ is 400 times faster than python,2018-04-27T14:35:49.060,15277
9202,6189,"1",That general figure doesn't mean anything -- it really depends on the exact application. I think 400 times is probably far too optimistic for most situations.  But the point is that if it takes you 500x longer to code (and debug!) the software, then even a 400x improvement in speed would still be slower!  Obviously the numbers are a bit random, but don't underestimate the time it takes you to get your program right. Often you'll find that the increase in speed is more than offset by faster development time.,2018-04-27T14:39:23.690,2193

9217,6184,"2",Yes, more or less, and it’s not just translation invariance but also size (scale) and rotation. Decision trees can represent more than just a group of pixels; I would be remiss to not say that feature engineering is often 90% of the work. A decision tree model can benefit hugely from that but interpretability will take a dip, depending on how you engineer your features. Generally, CNNs don’t require the feature engineering in a meaningful way because they were developed specifically for vision tasks. You can think of them as an algorithm specialized more for vision problems.,2018-04-27T16:23:04.040,5210

9259,6233,"0",I don't see how it can't be calculated. The first unresolved value you get is when calculating 5 (3 -> 5).

Considering 0 has a value of .5, 1 has a value of .8, and 3 is unresolved, you may consider the following

v5 = .5 * w0 + .8 * w1 + (3?) * w3
Where the 3? is an unresolved value. I think the hack here is to initialize it to zero so your equation becomes 
v5 = .5 * w0 + .8 * w1 + 0 * w3
Reduces to
v5 = .5 * w0 + .8 * w1

This can calculate a value for 5 that can be used to calculate 2. You can then calculate 3 from 2. Then the next time 5 is calculated the value wouldn't be zero,2018-05-01T21:11:33.980,1720

So you are not explicitly programmed. Similarly if you don't give the ai an option to lie, similar to if someone did not give you '*' then they will not lie and you will not learn about multiplication.,2018-05-07T00:40:19.323,9947
9334,6291,"0",If something is programmed to output its findings then by default it is programmed to not lie since a lie would be hiding a result or returning incorrect data on purpose.  So, to program anything to not lie isn't an issue.

9518,6379,"1",It's interesting you talk about graphs. Because my instinct was telling me that some kind of entity that navigates the nodes of a graph would might be complex enough. But I worry that a finite graph with finite things going on would be rather limited. But in another way, our own lives are rather limited when you think about it: eat;work;sleep;repeat. However, if the entities had to compete (or collaborate) with other entities, perhaps more complex behaviour would occur with them trying to second-guess each other.,2018-05-14T22:26:21.153,4199

Lol your right similarity may not be a property of phillosophy but a nature of its determination from classification and objection should be a product of speculation and subject to argument my good fellow lol,2018-05-20T20:44:07.573,9094

9624,6475,"0",No i am not a troll every truth and conclusion of an argument leads from a predicate and there should be a method to conclude similarity in a perceptual predicate.

9625,6461,"0",Data compression is not a function of intelligence optimisation is a function of the output and input purity and compression reduces the product of that algorithm with the nature of a purity in the collection from observation and subject to compression of data from a world and its predisposition of its world but that compression only results in an efficient process in an output but if you regard intelligence in a process of information then a reduction in data does not attribute to this process because its just quantity not speed in manipulation.,2018-05-20T21:27:24.127,9094
9626,6461,"0",Data compression is a computer function but is not a predicate of its manipulation by an algorithm. Compression is a predetermined method before a subjection to manipulation but results in a manipulation and output at a greater rate if the algorithm subjects that data from it at an increased mutated rate that its a product of. Mutated algorithms process input from a source of data that can be determined or not but output the same regardless of the mutation prediction comes from affirmation a determined state that ouputs its input and clarifies the prediction and observation from that propechy!,2018-05-20T21:53:36.347,9094

9630,6455,"0",the link mentioned above is simply explaining the naive autoencoder, the bottom line, data in high dimensional space always lie in a lower dimensional space called manifold, where the probability concentrates and decrease abruptly  as you go far away from the manifold, of course, the manifold could be composed of a set of non-connected manifolds (modes), for more explanation see ch14 of http://www.deeplearningbook.org/,2018-05-21T07:28:36.660,11911
9631,6455,"0",So if I understood correctly, for an autoencoder, Id calculate the probability of a function h given data x that best describes x?

9632,6455,"1",If the data distribution is concentrated on x^3+1 with some variance, the model will try to put more probability on points that are similar to the training data and puts a lower probability on points that don't resemble the data distribution based on the maximum likelihood principle.,2018-05-21T08:28:58.580,11911

9637,6475,"0",@Bobs you have gone very deep with the thought process...I appreciate it, you opened up a new viewpoint for me....In short you are trying to say that the OP should come up with a function/measure to define similarity or dissimilarity of images..and then train that function...correct?,2018-05-21T10:27:43.043,9947
9638,6475,"1",A simpler way of putting this: The OP has to define "similarity" by some kind of measure. There is no single correct, objective measure. The section labelled "trickier cases" gets closer to it. Consider the two men and woman against plain background. Which is more important: 1) pose of person (is one man standing with back facing camera, woman and man both facing camera) 2) colour or nature of background 3) colour of hair/skin/eye, clothing or some cultural similarity between the people  . . . etc, etc. There is no "true" answer, the goal can be highly subjective, depending on the data set,2018-05-21T15:07:32.240,1847
9639,6477,"2",I would go further and say that it is not even possible to define the problem with high accuracy, although I like the approach of comparing open-ended text annotations, because in theory these will emulate the subjectivity of comparing photos done by people (at least in a given context, such as how they would be labelled when uploaded to the internet).,2018-05-21T15:11:07.650,1847
9640,6479,"0",Could you apply a log transformation to it? That would mean that the more frequent data points close to NN (sea level) would still have a good range, while the (presumably rarer?) extreme values would be compressed.,2018-05-21T15:41:56.913,2193
9643,6457,"0",The 1050ti should be the same speed as the k80, Large data should not result on overfitting BUT what if you have a very very very large model? "with a second net after the first" even with non trainable parameters. by the way, your approach is somehow ill-defined. if you insist to work on some crazy idea, consider toy problems with small (synthetic) dataset and iterate from there. All researcher try their experiments with a suitable computing/time budget.,2018-05-21T19:29:51.353,11911
9644,6479,"0",Hi, thanks. I know that’s a common practice with depth/distance data but the problem as I mentioned is that my data can also be negative and log is undefined for non-positive values..,2018-05-21T19:50:14.890,15776
9645,6477,"0",Thanks for the idea. In fact I do have access to some textual metadata, but unfortunately that would only help me solve the easy cases, e.g. "a car is probably more similar to another car than to a dog", however for the trickier cases textual metadata falls short, which makes me believe I need to resort to some kind of fine-grained visual features to break ties. In fact my goal is to learn an embedding with a Neural Network using a Triplet Loss, but the crucial problem lies in generating accurate triplet samples, including both easy and tricky cases. Hence my question.,2018-05-21T21:57:04.203,12746
9646,6477,"0",One idea I have in mind is to extract a ton of features using different techniques (pre-trained CNNs, handcrafted features, etc.) and somehow figure out a hybrid score that combines the "opinions" of all the individual features. A sort of "mixture of experts". This hybrid score would let me judge which image is the most similar to the query image Q. But I have no idea of how to define such a hybrid score.,2018-05-21T22:21:39.580,12746

Of course, regularization matters (how high of polynomial order should we permit?) and tanh or relu might not be the most efficient basis to approximate a polynomial, but, in the end, the only "dimension" that really matters is the number of knobs on the fitted function (weights and biases, or polynomial coefficients, or Fourier modes).,2018-05-27T20:24:47.857,15050

9726,6544,"1",Yes, the agent is used against the incoming data. However, all the correct answers are not available immediately, so the teaching from the new data has a delay. Obviously, the recognition won't run _for a while_ until the agent _knows_ enough.Then it continues to improve as more data comes in. The delay could be around 1h, although that in itself is not too important. "the performance remaining constant" is certainly the bit I was looking for. Thank you.,2018-05-29T09:44:15.380,15927

And similarly if the selling price is 0 and the buying price is 1 it should learn not to buy anything.

To be honest, the idea of a generic application of ANNs is similar to the popular but farcical conceptualization of general intelligence.

9756,6527,"2",Shortest and most effective are mutually exclusive in cases such as this. Consider that NLP is a subject of immense proportions in its infancy. A more realistic goal would be to try to learn something significant about NLP and implement something of note before you retire. Certainly you can find cookie cutter solutions that others have discovered and apply them for some client and get paid, but that isn't really, "learning NLP." It is copying example code and changing some details to fit an app. I suggest you let go of your "shortest" requirement.,2018-05-30T08:59:07.287,4302

9775,6567,"1",What you call a crossover sounds like a selection (likely close to the truncation selection). I may be wrong, but check your implementation and/or understanding.

Apart from that, when the average fitness across the population stops changing it most likely means that the population has converged to a very small region of the search space and now consists of very similar individuals.,2018-05-31T09:08:31.077,15881

9781,6585,"0",I just threw that genetic in there to bridge to the real world, but what I described is basically a genetic algorithm and I believe that is the best path to replicating intelligence. If you only try to mimic intelligent creatures you are never going to get into the domain of independent learning or creativity, because the agent can only do what it has been shown. And you would have to show it a huge amount of data about humans for it to become a reasonable representation of a human.,2018-05-31T13:43:06.910,3948

9814,6543,"0",Appreciate the feedback.  I am considering a modified version of any bounding box model.  Instead of the coordinates defining the box, it would just be the coordinates for the tip and end of the instrument.  So for instance, for a pencil, the tip would be the sharp lead writing part while the end would be the eraser.  For forceps, the tip would be the clamp of the forceps while the end would be the handle, where the forceps are attached.  I just do not know if this approach can work.  I wanted to get some confidence before labeling all the training data before going ahead with this approach.,2018-06-01T03:16:46.523,15865

9829,6541,"0",The use of modelling in learning does not rely on prediction for justification. Modelling is central to cognition, language use, surface fitting by formula or by convergence, optimization of any kind, and dependency or causality graphing. The book's authors might categorize the first and fifth of those as planning, but they'd be improperly extending a word that describes a higher layer of intelligence to lower operations. A model of reality must be used instead of the external reality models solely because digital devices cannot ingest reality and manipulate it from within the silicon chip.,2018-06-01T09:36:10.323,4302
9830,6541,"0",One side point ... When learning occurs in production, as is always the case in reinforcement (just a trendy name for Wiener's real time feedback), less than optimal choices always have a cost. Time and computing resource costs can easily exceed robot repair costs. You are correct nonetheless that prediction is often employed to minimize cost. Another use of prediction is its employment to maximize revenue or some loftier goal.,2018-06-01T09:45:19.427,4302

Self awareness is a reference to it's self logically ànd we measure consiuosness from this quality which we observe, if we are a product of creation and awareness results in individual observation from that creation then without creation we are unable to observe unless consiouness is able to observe itself without creation from self reference with no measure.,2018-06-03T01:26:32.553,9094
